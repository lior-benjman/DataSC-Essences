191367913,1743155743,True,great game have thoroughly enjoyed it.. only issue is obviously the cowards that choose to cheat and use hacks.
191110649,1742858268,True,"Okay, I have over 1,000 hours in CS:GO.  And somehow, despite all the blood, sweat, and keyboard rage I’ve poured into this game, I’m still here—writing a review about how much I absolutely despise it. But… I love it. I really do. CS:GO is like the toxic ex you can’t quit—every time you swear it off, it pulls you back in with a clutch play or a smooth headshot that makes you think, “Maybe I’m actually good at this.” Spoiler: I’m not.  The community? Oh, it’s a beautiful dumpster fire. It's like walking into a room full of people who think they’re the next esports prodigy while you’re just over here trying to figure out how to properly throw a flashbang without blinding yourself. It’s a chaotic mess where everyone is a god, and I am the unfortunate 13-year-old with a voice crack trying to explain why I didn’t buy armor because I just had enough money for a deagle. “BUY A DEFUSER!” they yell, even though I was the one who defused the bomb last round, you ungrateful pixel warrior. The language in this game? Oh boy. It's like a master class in toxic masculinity and insecurity. I’ve never heard so many grown men act like their whole identity hinges on being the best at a 10-year-old game. It’s always the same—guys who are so insecure about their skill who’ve convinced themselves that yelling at random strangers online will somehow make them feel better about their lives.  Somehow, I keep coming back. I guess I’m addicted to the pain. The matchmaking system? More like ""matchmaking mystery."" Every time I join a game, I’m greeted by a mix of 12-year-olds who think they’re in Call of Duty and people who are just aggressively shouting in their mics. ""I’m a pro"" says one guy with a 1-8 K/D. Alright, buddy, sure. You know what though? I love it. There’s something about CS:GO that keeps me coming back. Sure, I’ve had my heart broken by the game more times than I can count (many, many, many opened cases with nothing but blue skins of despair), but every time I hear the sweet sound of the bomb ticking down, or the satisfying clink of a headshot, I remember why I keep playing. Would I recommend this game to anyone? Well, yes, but only if you’re ready to experience frustration, confusion, and an unhealthy dependency on substances. CS:GO is like that abusive relationship that always promises it’ll get better, but deep down, we all know the truth: it won’t.   But hey, I’ll still be playing tomorrow.  1/10, but like, a 10/10 for masochism.  Also Valve, your anti-cheat system is like a fire extinguisher that only works when there’s no fire. It bans me for breathing too loudly, but hackers are out here flying around the map like it’s GTA. Maybe it's time for VAC to actually start working instead of just pretending it's on the job while hackers run wild."
193017809,1744981685,False,Unplayable for newcomers. 9 out of 10 games are Hacker vs Hacker Lobbies. thx valve for not giving a f*ck about your game and preferring to add skins instead of actually working on it
192462235,1744324898,False,"Тhe game had potential, but it's completely ruined by the overwhelming number of hackers. It's frustrating and unfair, making it almost unplayable. Developers need to take action before it's too late."
193048807,1745007902,False,"Full of cheaters, still unoptimized after so long, and basically its a heavy greasy poop of a game"
192138470,1743947378,False,"I have been playing counter-strike since it was a mod, before Valve bought the rights and before steam was even a thing. I have had no issues until CS:GO where hackers seemed to go unchecked and if you tried to report anyone valve wouldn't let you for a time and said they have a full proof anti-cheat method. CS2 was coming out and I was excited for it since it would be an upgrade to visuals and gameplay. It has some improvements but hackers are still a problem more in comp and premier than in casual surprisingly.    Steam from the articles I have read are using AI and a report from another player to catch cheaters now, this however is showing false positives, there are videos discussing this in more detail where the number of ""caught"" cheaters has increased exponentially. I myself have not cheated in any game, ran any scripts, etc. Yet I have now been punished twice in two different pods of 5 despite no actual vac bans and no word on who was even suspected of cheating, instead we get a generic message of ""Irregular Gameplay"" and the whole team is penalized. First time was 20 hours, I figured I just won't play with those guys again as I only knew one of them anyways. The second time I met 3 clan guys friended one of them and ran with one of their friends and the match ended early. We were losing both matches by a lot and we suspected the top frag player on the other team of hacking given how great he was compared to everyone else. The second time was a 3 day cooldown and since I don't hack I opened a steam ticket and almost 3 days later there is no response. I have spent a lot of money on opening cases and everything so I find it very crappy that Steam/Valve has decided to ignore my ticket and derank me a second time on premier when I was not cheating at all.    I have friends who play premier and I want to play with them which is why I was getting my rank up which peak was around 3500 which isn't very high. Most of my friends got theirs up to 10k+ and the game doesn't allow you to play if the level difference is too high, which I understand the reason is so players don't get boosted. My issue now is that I am forced to play with full randos as if I join a stack, I risk getting cooldowned again or banned if someone else is cheating or has ""Irregular Gameplay"".     I will still play the game but I don't see a point in trying to do comp or premier anymore nor do I see the point in spending money in a game that allows actual cheaters to play the game while penalizing those it just thinks might be cheating. This makes me want to go to back to COD but most of my friends play CS2. If you are looking for a game to play competitive this game is definitely not it.     Cheating is not the only reason not to get this game, CS2 has been out for 2 years and I was a little down that they eliminated a lot of maps, but they brought new versions at the same time. They announced they were bringing new maps, for hostage rescue, there are only 2 maps where before we had more. I would have thought that we would get 2 new hostage maps but both times they released 2 maps for a total of 4, they were defusal maps and the first two weren't for casual or comp but only wingman (2 v2). They release skins and they are nice but cheating is a problem, since Q3 of last year flagging accounts who aren't cheating has been a problem and we still only have 2 hostage maps that one has always been since beta the other since 2000, 25 years old. Meanwhile most of the defusal maps are newer or have had major upgrades to design layout.    If you already own the game, sure you can keep playing it but if Valve/Steam continues in the direction they have been headed they will destory the player base for this game. If you don't own this game, I do not recommend you buy it and purchase price is they charge money to play premier/comp, 15 dollars. It isn't worth it."
192221362,1744035922,False,"Go outside. Exercise. Read a good book. Connect with God. Go do something else, anything else... to prevent yourself from never taking accountability, growing angry, and wallowing in self-pity."
191400828,1743185856,False,"Counter-Strike 2 was supposed to be the evolution of CS:GO. A fresh engine, better graphics, smoother gameplay. In reality? It's a downgrade in disguise. Sure, the core gunplay still slaps, the maps look cleaner, and Source 2 brings a nice visual upgrade. But once you scratch the surface, the issues hit you like a flashbang to the face.  🔸 CS:GO was just better. More features, better balance, less chaos. CS2 feels like a stripped-down, half-baked remake with prettier lighting. It lacks the polish and reliability that made CS:GO feel like home.  🔸 Cheaters. Everywhere. Despite all the “improved anti-cheat” talk from Valve, CS2 is swarming with wallhackers, spinbotters, and aim-assisted clowns. VAC is more of a meme than a system. You might get one clean match out of five – if you're lucky.  🔸 Account leaks through streams. Let that sink in – people literally lost their Steam accounts just by watching CS2 streams on Twitch. No phishing, no clicking shady links – just watching a major event. And Valve? Dead silent. No statement, no apology, no help.  🔸 Server quality is laughable. 64 tick servers in 2025 is just unacceptable. We were promised 128 tick – we got smoke gimmicks and laggy peeks. Rubberbanding, packet loss, and straight-up disconnects still happen. It’s like playing on a potato sometimes.  🔸 Missing content at launch. CS2 launched like an early-access game. No community servers, no classic modes, missing features from CS:GO that players used every day. And they’re slowly trickling back... keyword: slowly.  🔸 Matchmaking and ranks are a joke. The ranking system feels totally random. Win streak? You derank. Lose a game? Here's your promotion. No transparency, no logic – just vibes and suffering.  Final thoughts: Counter-Strike 2 could be amazing. The gameplay foundation is still gold – it's fast, competitive, and adrenaline-pumping. But Valve has a long way to go before this game deserves to stand above CS:GO.  At the moment, I play CS2 not because it’s great, but because there's no real alternative. And deep down, I still miss CS:GO – the better, more complete version of the game I fell in love with.  Final rating: 7/10 – for what it could be, not what it currently is."
192309190,1744136733,True,"🇬🇧 English: My journey with Counter-Strike began back in the days of version 1.5. I fell in love with the pure competitive spirit hidden within those simple pixels. Every round, every clutch moment, every aim duel stirred a unique excitement inside me. CS wasn’t just a game to me—it was a passion, a love, a way of life. I spent days grinding, nights without sleep, dreaming of becoming a pro. I wanted to wear a team jersey, compete in tournaments, and hear my name echo in the arena. But talent alone wasn’t enough, and the circumstances at the time didn’t work in my favor. Still, the fire in me never faded.  As the years passed, versions evolved—CS 1.6, Source, Global Offensive—and I followed them all. I was always there, part of it. But eventually, the unfairness within the game—especially the cheaters—began to drain my love for it. Every match started to feel pointless. ""Was there a cheater again?"" became my routine question.  At some point, I gave in. I betrayed the purity of my passion. I told myself, “If everyone else is doing it, why not me?” I deeply regret it to this day. I ended up getting my most valuable accounts—full of years of effort and memories—banned. The shame of those actions still lingers within me like a scar.  But even through all that, I never stopped loving CS. Because CS was a reflection of me. The sounds of gunfire, the ticking bombs, the mid-round calls—they became the soundtrack of my youth. The discipline, reaction speed, and mental strength I developed thanks to CS helped me far beyond the screen.  Now, CS2 is here. With a brand-new engine, more realistic physics, advanced lighting and shadows—it offers a fresh, immersive experience. But to be honest, it still needs work. Optimization issues, matchmaking problems, and bugs still affect gameplay. However, that doesn't mean it can’t improve. CS has always been a game that evolves and matures over time.  Counter-Strike is my childhood love. My first passion. My first real thrill. And that kind of love never dies. It only transforms. CS will live on forever—because it lives in us. In the players who gave their hearts to it.  CS never dies. It simply gets reborn.  🇹🇷 Türkçe: Counter-Strike serüvenim 1.5 sürümüyle başladı. O basit piksellerin içinde saklı o saf rekabet ruhuna âşık oldum. Her round, her clutch anı, her aim kapışması içimde ayrı bir heyecan yaratıyordu. CS benim için sadece bir oyun değildi—bir tutkuydu, bir aşktı, bir yaşam biçimiydi. Günlerce oynadım, gecelerce uykusuz kaldım. Profesyonel olmak istedim. Takım forması giymek, turnuvalara katılmak, ismimi arenada duymak... Ama yetenek tek başına yetmedi, o zamanki şartlar da buna izin vermedi. Yine de içimdeki o kıvılcım hiç sönmedi.  Yıllar geçtikçe sürümler değişti—CS 1.6, Source, Global Offensive—ve ben hepsini takip ettim. Hep içindeydim, bir parçasıydım. Ama zamanla, özellikle hileciler yüzünden oyundaki adaletsizlik sevgimi tüketmeye başladı. Her maçın ardından aklımda tek bir cümle dönüp duruyordu: “Yine hile mi vardı?”  Bir noktada ben de yenik düştüm. O tertemiz tutkumu kirlettim. “Herkes yapıyor, ben de deneyeyim” dedim. Bugün hâlâ pişmanım. Yıllarca emek verdiğim, anılar biriktirdiğim en değerli hesaplarım ban yedi. O anların utancı hâlâ içimde bir yara gibi duruyor.  Ama tüm bunlara rağmen CS’yi sevmekten asla vazgeçmedim. Çünkü CS, bana ayna tutuyordu. Silah sesleri, bombaların tıkırtısı, round ortasında gelen takım çağrıları—gençliğimin fon müziği oldu. CS sayesinde geliştirdiğim refleks, disiplin ve mental direnç ekranın ötesine geçti; hayatta da bana yol gösterdi.  Ve şimdi CS2 geldi. Yepyeni bir oyun motoru, daha gerçekçi fizik kuralları, gelişmiş ışık ve gölge efektleriyle taze ve derin bir deneyim sunuyor. Ama dürüst olmak gerekirse hâlâ eksikleri var. Optimizasyon sıkıntıları, eşleştirme sorunları ve bazı hatalar oyun keyfini baltalıyor. Ancak bu gelişmeyeceği anlamına gelmiyor. CS her zaman zamanla gelişen ve olgunlaşan bir oyun oldu.  Counter-Strike benim çocukluk aşkım. İlk tutkum. İlk gerçek heyecanım. Ve böyle bir aşk asla ölmez. Sadece şekil değiştirir. CS sonsuza dek yaşayacak—çünkü onu yaşatan bizleriz. Ona kalbini vermiş oyuncular.  CS asla ölmez. Sadece yeniden doğar."

One of the most noticeable upgrades is the stunning visual overhaul. The game now features more detailed environments and realistic effects, making each match more immersive. The gameplay remains true to the classic Counter-Strike style—fast-paced, strategic, and skill-based—yet the updates add a fresh feel that keeps it exciting for both new and veteran players.  The matchmaking system has been refined for better balance and quicker queue times, which is great for players eager to jump into action. Additionally, the weapon handling and movement feel more responsive, giving players a greater sense of control and precision.  Community features and customization options have also been expanded, allowing players to personalize their experience and connect more easily with others. The game’s sound design continues to be top-notch, providing crucial audio cues that can make the difference between victory and defeat.  Overall, CS2 successfully modernizes a classic while respecting its roots. It’s a must-try for fans of competitive shooters and anyone looking for a fast, tactical multiplayer experience.

193130738,1745094170,True,"Counter-Strike 2 is an incredibly engaging and competitive game that truly captures the spirit of tactical shooters. The thrill of outsmarting your opponents, working as a team, and improving your skills is what keeps you coming back for more. It’s a game that pulls you in and makes you want to push your limits — and for that, it absolutely deserves a recommendation. However, it’s not without its frustrations. One of the biggest issues is the presence of cheaters. The VAC anti-cheat system doesn’t seem to be keeping up, and that seriously affects the experience. Facing obvious hackers ruins the competitive vibe and turns matches into a mess. Another challenge is the community. If you value your peace of mind, you might want to think twice before jumping in — or consider more relaxing games like Minecraft or Farm Frenzy. Toxic players, constant pressure, and rage-inducing rounds are pretty much guaranteed. This isn’t a casual shooter — it’s a mental battlefield. The shooting mechanics have also changed significantly compared to CS:GO. The way bullets register, especially headshots, feels inconsistent and sometimes downright strange. Veteran players will need time to adapt. In conclusion, I do recommend CS2 for its intensity, excitement, and deep competitive gameplay. But be ready — this game will test not only your aim but also your patience. It’s a wild ride, and definitely not for the faint of heart."
193116031,1745081559,False,I've played this game for over a decade. It's become the most BLATANT CHEATER infested game to date. Don't waste your time or money.

192991728,1744949534,True,"Here's a well-structured English review for CS2:   ---   **Counter-Strike 2: The Gold Standard of Tactical Shooters Just Got Better**   Valve's Counter-Strike 2 isn't just an update - it's a masterclass in how to evolve a legendary franchise while staying true to its roots. As someone who's spent countless hours since the 1.6 days, I can confidently say this is the most polished and thrilling iteration yet.   **Gameplay Perfection Refined**  The core DNA that made CS:GO an esports titan remains untouched, but subtle improvements elevate every match. The new sub-tick networking system is a revelation, making every bullet registration and movement tweak feel buttery smooth. Smoke grenades becoming dynamic volumetric objects adds unprecedented strategic depth - watching smoke swirl through bullet tracers never gets old.   **Visual Overhaul Done Right**  Source 2 engine works wonders without compromising performance. Maps like Overpass and Nuke glow with stunning lighting effects, while weapon models showcase incredible detail. The minimalist HUD redesign keeps focus on the action where it belongs.   **Sound Design Excellence**  From the crisp AK-47 echo in Mirage's apartments to the satisfying *clink* of a defuse kit, audio cues are now spatial masterpieces. I've literally dodged headshots based purely on sound positioning - that's next-level immersion.   **Community First Philosophy**  Valve's commitment to preserving skins/inventory while enabling full cross-play demonstrates rare respect for players. The new Workshop tools empower creators like never before, ensuring endless fresh content.   **Minor Growing Pains**  While the limited initial map pool and occasional server hiccups are noticeable, Valve's rapid update cadence shows they're listening. This is clearly a foundation built for decades, not quick cash grabs.   **Verdict**  Counter-Strike 2 isn't just the new king of tactical shooters - it's a love letter to competitive gaming. Whether you're a dusty veteran or fresh recruit, this is PC multiplayer at its"

Also the movement with the new game engine is fucking trash. I had about 2000+ in csgo and after 25hrs of cs2 i would have uninstalled if not for my friend. The sole reason i still play and even paid for prime is because i've got a friend who plays with me."
192874224,1744817391,True,"One of the best FPS games out there, despite its flaws.  Counter-Strike is, for me, the ultimate FPS. Whether you’re chilling with friends or sweating in competitive, the game is insanely addictive.  Yeah, it’s true, the gameplay often favors the “run & shoot in the head” style, and shotguns can feel kinda cheaty sometimes (looking at you, MAG-7 and Nova up close 😅), but still, the overall feel is unmatched.  Nothing beats the adrenaline of a 1v3 clutch, a perfectly placed smoke, or a clean headshot. It’s not perfect, but that’s what makes it fun, controlled chaos."

192066745,1743876243,False,"VAC connection issue is just embarrassing. Valve fails to detect cheaters, but normal players face this dogsh*t daily. I am just to lazy to find a better game, but CS seem to be done. Pure crap."
192050028,1743864163,True,I'm a huge fan of this game because of how positive the community is. You never run into cheaters and Valve is constantly releasing HUGE updates that make the game more enjoyable. I couldn't think of a better game to play and relax on after a hard days work!
191974870,1743787472,True,"The game is far from perfect. The biggest issue is the anti-cheat—it’s simply not good enough. Cheaters are still a huge problem, especially in matchmaking, and it can ruin the experience. The game also has performance issues and lacks some features that were present in CS:GO, making it feel a bit unfinished. If you can handle the occasional cheater and some technical issues, the core gameplay is still nice."

191845764,1743646034,False,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy playing CS2 with my friends, except Valve is just completely screwing us over with this game at this point. Not only did they completely get rid of CSGO but here we are TWO YEARS later and CS2 still is NOT a finished game. It's just a less complete CSGO. We don't even have all of the maps from CSGO yet! We've received no new content; no new maps, not a single new weapon, no word on any operations... but hey we [i]have[/i] gotten a TON of new skins to spend money on. I absolutely understand that Valve can't just make drastic changes to an already perfect game but sheesh just give us SOMETHING. God forbid they make any tweaks that could jeopardize losing any of their regularly-case-opening player base. Extremely disappointing that Valve treats CS2 more like a money printer rather than an actual ongoing game."
191822368,1743620350,False,Terrible game still riddled with cheaters and no anti-cheat actually exist. Closet cheaters are rampant everywhere and ofc instead of fixing this issue they release more skins. Trying to push the skin yout-ubers and content creators to mask the outstanding issues with the state of the game.
191791891,1743591276,True,not an easy game. I suck at it but I cant stop playing it. High risk high reward with fast reaction speed that i dont have at the moment
191787877,1743585646,False,"After spending over 8000 hours in CS:GO and CS2, I can confidently say that Counter-Strike 2 is a true technological leap forward. The game looks stunning – the Source 2 engine brings sharper textures, better lighting, and more realistic effects, making the atmosphere even more immersive. Since its release, numerous updates have improved optimization, movement, and the overall gameplay experience. And I have to admit, the result is fantastic. CS2 plays exceptionally well, matches feel dynamic, shooting is precise, and the addictive gameplay that defines the series remains intact. The game keeps pulling me back, making me want to play again and again.  But unfortunately, there is one huge flaw that I simply can’t ignore – cheaters. Cheating has always been an issue in Counter-Strike, but in CS2, it feels even worse than in CS:GO. Whether it's wallhacks, aimbots, or other unfair advantages, it seems like almost every match has at least one player exploiting the system. Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) simply isn’t enough, and its detection system doesn’t seem to be working effectively.  A better anti-cheat system – Valve should implement more advanced detection methods, something similar to Riot’s Vanguard or Faceit’s anti-cheat system. Permanent bans for repeat offenders, faster detection of cheaters, and restrictions on creating new accounts. A better Overwatch system – Bringing back the community-driven investigation system that worked in CS:GO.  CS:GO introduced the Danger Zone mode, a battle royale variant that brought a fresh and exciting twist to Counter-Strike. It featured dynamic fights, a great gear progression system, and a tactical element that made it stand out from other BR games. Simply put, it was a fun way to play CS with a different approach. It’s a real shame that CS2 doesn’t include this mode. If Valve brought Danger Zone back with improved graphics and better optimization, it would be a massive win for the community. Combined with a solid anti-cheat system, CS2 could become an even greater game than it already is.  Counter-Strike 2 is an excellent game that introduces many improvements, but it still suffers from old problems that have only gotten worse. If Valve can effectively combat cheating and bring back great modes like Danger Zone, CS2 could become the ultimate Counter-Strike experience. Until then, it remains a bittersweet game.  Valve, bring back Danger Zone!"
191786931,1743584151,True,i play this game for fun only to play with the most braindead teamates i have ever seen and instead of having fun i want to put a shotgun in my mouth after i die to the most lucky recoil headshot known to man     really fun would play again(not)
191779496,1743572112,True,"Game sucks and lacks half the content csgo had. Every update only adds skins to drive their lottery instead of consistent anti cheat, 128 tick servers, and new maps. Performance on most computers are terrible since valve decided to jerk off in the map creator instead of making a functioning map. Play this game if you deeply hate yourself and other people. Prime and free to play ruined csgo and it only continues with this game."

Forcing game to 64 tick rate to ""not have community divided and try and get everyone to play premiere"" then having absolutely pitiful AC was a terrible decision.   It's still ""CS"" and some aspects of the game are better than ever, but for above reason would not recommend this to anyone who isn't masochistic."

191404901,1743189095,True,"I started playing Counter-Strike as a way to unwind, to escape reality. Little did I know, it would end up pulling me deeper into an abyss, taking everything along with it. The thrill of every match, the adrenaline rush of clutch moments — it was intoxicating, but slowly, the game became my world.    At first, it was just a game. My family and friends were still there, waiting for me to come back to reality. But the long hours, the late nights, the endless grind for ranks — it all started to bleed into my life outside the screen. Calls were ignored, messages went unanswered. I lost track of birthdays, important events, and even moments that should've mattered more than the next kill in the game. It wasn't just about winning anymore; it was about the rush, the satisfaction of escaping into a world where I could be someone else.    But I lost more than just time. I lost connections. Relationships faded, and soon enough, the only people I spoke to were strangers across the globe, exchanging insults and praise in the heat of competition. The ones I loved drifted further away, and the ones I didn’t even know became the ones I interacted with the most. The outside world felt distant, irrelevant.    And then there was the emptiness. What was once a form of entertainment morphed into an obsession. The game was no longer something I could walk away from. The weight of every loss, the tension in every match, became my reality. I lost my family, my friends, and in some way, I lost myself. The sense of purpose that once existed in daily life faded. The game consumed me, and now, as I reflect, all I see is a hollow version of the person I used to be.    Counter-Strike isn’t just a game anymore. It’s a reminder of how far I’ve fallen. Every match, every round, feels like a small piece of me slipping further away, and I’m not sure I’ll ever get it back."

191355357,1743137859,False,"CS2 had big shoes to fill coming off the legacy of CSGO but man it’s been a letdown. I’ll just say it CSGO was better. The switch to this new subtick system sounded cool on paper but in practice, it feels like absolute garbage. Shots that should hit just don’t register half the time  and it makes the whole game feel clunky and unresponsive. I don’t know who thought this was an upgrade but they need to go back to the drawing board. And don’t even get me started on the hackers. They’re everywhere like infest the game levels of everywhere. You can’t even escape them in casual modes like Deathmatch. I’m out here trying to warm up and it’s just farm bots and aimlockers ruining every round. It’s not just a Premier problem the whole game. Valve’s anti-cheat is straight-up nonexistent. What else? The optimization’s still shaky, the community’s frustrated and it feels like Valve’s more focused on pushing skins than fixing core issues. CS:GO wasn’t perfect but it had soul and a polish that CS2 missing. Valve, seriously fix your game man. Subtick is a mess, hackers are rampant and the vibes are off.   (Do better)"

Just make sure you have a alt account to continue pissing off the entire community, and don't expect content drops more than once a year.

Less maps. less modes, server communities are dead and hidden away like you are Harry Potter at the Dursley's house.

191038008,1742776190,True,"Counter-Strike 2: A Masterpiece of Pain and Suffering  Counter-Strike 2 is a thrilling tactical shooter where every round is a heart-pounding test of skill, strategy, and patience. Unfortunately, the biggest challenge isn’t just the enemy team—it’s the guy on the other side of the map who somehow pre-fires your exact position every round.    Yes, the game is sometimes unplayable due to an infestation of wall hackers and aim-botters who apparently think esports contracts are handed out in Silver rank. But don’t worry, your teammates will balance things out by having the reaction time of a potato and the aim of a stormtrooper.    Speaking of teammates, be prepared to carry games like a pack mule, dropping 30 bombs while your team collectively struggles to defuse a bomb that was planted in their dreams. But no matter how well you play, Premier mode ensures you’ll still lose all your ELO faster than a stock market crash.    Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is an amazing experience—if you enjoy a mix of adrenaline, betrayal, and existential crisis.   10/10, would queue again (and regret it immediately)."

Again, great game, but i cannot recommend CS2 in its current state as an enjoyable Friday night competitive game.

191379011,1743167998,False,"I love this game, it likely is the best competitive game ever made. . .  BUT  After the switch from GO to CS2 I can't recommend this game in good faith. Many of the issues that plagued GO are still present in 2, as well as new unique issues that feel like they should of been ironed out way before this games release.  -Cheaters: This game, even with prime, is filled to the brim with cheaters. I'd say I run into cheaters every 5th game I play, often they don't even try hiding it, and even after being reported 100s of times many of them still are running free ruining the experience for others. VAC is an absolute joke in its current form, and I am yet to have a match canceled live.   -Ranking system: I was close to Master Guardian in GO, and despite that when I got back into CS2 it ranked me in silver 2-3 for most maps and 4K for premier even though I was dropping 20-30 bombs in almost all of my placements. I don't want to smurf, nor do I want to grind every single map up to where I was in GO. Frankly the ranking system doesn't even feel existent, its almost as if valve has the approach of ""you'll get there eventually"" with no thought to how this effects the lower ranks ability to climb.   -""what you see is what you get"": yeah. . . no, just straight up no. Fake head shots (even with predictive damage off), terrible net-coding, weirdness of random/running shots post sub tick, the mushy feel of movement compared to GO, tracers landing directly on target only to be told ""2 for 54"". The feel of this game is a victim of death by a thousand cuts, small issues that collectively makes it far less responsive than GO. As AleksiB said ""Download CSGO, and go shoot one bot at a server. It feels so crisp, like you're gonna cry.""    It truly saddens me that such legendary game is being neglected the way it is, Valve updates this game. . . to sell things, but hasn't done much to actually improve the game past were it was on launch. If changes are made for the better, I will delete this, but for now the issues are far to bad for me to ignore and I wouldn't recommend it in its current state."

Now, my friends aren’t around anymore, and I deeply regret not enjoying those moments with them.  The game itself is incredible — refined gameplay, great graphics, and a solid community. But the time I missed out on still lingers with me. If you’re thinking about getting into the game, don’t make the same mistake I did.

193210504,1745176249,True,"A Love Letter to Terrorists, Tactical Peeking, and an Inexplicable Chicken Uprising    I went into Counter-Strike 2 expecting nothing more than a nostalgic bloodbath, but what I got instead was a physics-defying, bunny-hopping opera of precision, betrayal, and the occasional poultry-based existential crisis.    Let me just say this up front: this game slaps harder than a Molotov cocktail at a pool party.    CS2 takes the soul of CS:GO, feeds it protein powder, dunks it in an HDR oil bath, and then throws it into a server where a 12-year-old from Norway snipes you through a smoke while quoting Sun Tzu in the chat. The tick rate has been upgraded and feels smoother than a jazz solo played by a caffeinated ferret. Peeking now feels like a moral decision. Sometimes I peek and think, “This is it, this is how I die,” and it’s beautiful.    The graphics are so crisp I accidentally tried to pet a smoke grenade thinking it was a real dog. The lighting effects make Dust2 look like it was designed by Christopher Nolan. And let’s talk about the new volumetric smokes—because holy frag grenade, they change the game. You can now shoot through them, and the bullets part the smoke like Moses parting the Red Sea, except instead of freeing people, you just shot someone named xX420N00bXx in the face.    Weapons still feel like they were handcrafted by angry dwarves in a competitive forge. Every AK spray pattern is a test of memory, muscle, and faith. The AWP still costs as much as rent in a major city but delivers the kind of dopamine hit that should probably be illegal in at least three countries.    But here's the weirdest part: the chickens. I swear there are more chickens, and they’re watching. I was defusing a bomb and three chickens walked up to me and just stared. No clucking. Just silence. They know something.    In conclusion, Counter-Strike 2 is the video game equivalent of yelling “LET’S GOOOO” in your room at 2AM after clutching a 1v4 while wearing a virtual balaclava. It’s sweaty. It’s sharp. It’s pure. If you liked CS:GO, this is your new religion. If you’ve never played before, buckle up. The terrorists may win, but so do you.    9.5/10 — would flashbang myself again."
191928145,1743738734,True,"The game is like the original Counter-Strike GO, but with 25% more ""I'm not mad, just disappointed"" moments. Graphics have had a glow-up, but so has the community's ability to yell at you for getting shot through a wall. Sub-tick is debatable.  Moreover, nothing says ""strategy"" like a cloud of smoke that can hide an entire team and the bomb.  It's the same high-octane, panic-inducing gameplay, just now with extra texture. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys heart attacks in digital form. Fix the damn server lag valve and give more gameplay content rather than just pumping skins.

The ratio is about 1/10 players is a cheater. You do the math.     This game also disincentivizes you reporting people by lowering your ""trust factor"" when you report people. Meaning the more you report people. The worse teammates you get matched up with a similar low ""trust factor""    Valve thinks AI-assisted Overwatch system will fix the cheating issue when they rarely even address reports.     I've probably seen 2 or 3 cheaters banned in my 185 hours. When i've met probably 80-100. Reported about as much as well.

I'm willing to accept an invasive anti-cheat system like Valorant uses if it means CS:2 is even 50% as good as CS:GO. This game actually hurts my feelings how far it's fallen from grace."

191094845,1742843081,False,"This game is complete garbage. They took a fine game, one that wasn't riddled with bugs, and turned it into this utter dogshit. You will die from people that don't even peek around the corner, the servers will always fail and have a lot of packet loss, your shots won't register and many more problems. I know CS:GO also wasn't without it's faults, but this is way worse. The cheater problem is more prominent than as well. At the current state I would steer clear from this game if you can. Utter garbage, fix your game Valve."
191835286,1743632628,False,"My honest review, they should add back all the maps we had in CS:GO with Armsrace. There are too many cheaters in the game still. It's a new game therefor it's supposed to be better, well guess what? ITS NOT. With CS:GO I could log into a armsrace game without having to worry if I will be kicked for no reason after i just logged in. They should have kept CS:GO and not replaced it with CS2. Let the people decide what they want to play. If they thought of it as a money thing then they should have kept CS:GO because they would have made more money then when it's 2 games running. I know it's easier said than done but if you producing a game at this level you are supposed to handle the stress of the 2 games running at the same time. I used to enjoy CS:GO a lot, but since they replaced it with CS2 I barely play the game. Coming back to the cheater situation, there are now even more hackers in the game than what there were with CS:GO. Also another reason why I don't really play the game that much anymore. I know that one can't live in the past but still. This is my honest opinion and you might disagree with me but it is just what it is."

Classic maps look better than ever, and gunplay feels insanely satisfying.    It’s still the same skill-based, high-intensity shooter, but modernized for the future. Whether you're clutching a 1v5 or landing pixel-perfect headshots, CS2 proves why Counter-Strike remains the king of FPS games.CS2 takes everything great about CS:GO and elevates it.

192004262,1743815828,False,"I'm disappointed in the game. I really enjoyed playing CS GO and its modes in my time. But what we see now. The game has changed, but not for the better. After CS GO became CS2, everything changed. It became impossible to play. Terrible hit registration, optimization problems (despite the fact that my system pulls the same Cyberpunk quite easily at maximum settings), constant freezes and crashes, a problem with cheaters, a strange hit prediction system and a bunch of other equally strange solutions, the lack of unique operatives on different maps, and so on. Maps are a separate pain. Many classic cards from the last game have sunk into oblivion. The overall design of the game has become too contrasting and oversaturated with colors. CS GO had a slight grayness, which gave it a special charm of a military tactical shooter.  Well, what became an extreme point for me was that the developers simply decided to abandon the old modes that were in CS GO. Especially the “Danger zone"". Just for the sake of her and other past modes, I endured and hoped that the game would pull through, but as I see it, the game is over. For me, CS2 has become a kind of half-corpse that is not allowed to die and at least try to get out.  I just don't feel like playing this game anymore, even though I've been familiar with this series since CS 1.6. It's a pity to see that the game is gradually sliding into the abyss. This is my personal opinion. At the moment, I'm going to look at the analogues I like, but I had enough for CS2.  Я разочарован в игре. Мне очень нравилось играть в свое время в CS GO и ее режимы. Но что мы видим сейчас. Игра изменилась, но не в лучшею сторону. После того как CS GO стала CS2 все изменилось. Играть стало невозможно. Ужасная регистрация попаданий, проблемы с оптимизацией (при том что моя система довольно легко тянет тот же Cyberpunk на максимальных настройках), постоянные зависания и вылеты, проблема с читерами, странная система предугадывания попаданий и куча других не менее странных решений, отсутствие уникальных оперативников на разных картах и прочее. Карты это отдельная боль. Многие классические карты из прошлой игры канули в небытие. Общий дизайн игры стал слишком контрастным и перенасыщенным красками. CS GO имела легкую серость, что давала ей особый шарм военно-тактического шутера.  Ну и что стало для меня крайней точкой так это то, что разработчики просто решили отказаться от старых режимов, которые были в CS GO. Особенно “Запретная зона”. Только ради нее и других прошлых режимов я терпел и надеялся что игра выкарабкается, но как я вижу игре конец. Для меня CS2 стала неким подобием полутрупа которому не дают умереть и хотя бы пытаться выкарабкаться.  У меня уже просто нет желания заходить в эту игру, хотя я знаком с этой серией еще с CS 1.6. Жалко видеть что игра постепенно скатывается в бездну. Это мое личное мнение. На данный момент я буду смотреть на приглянувшиеся аналоги, но для CS2 меня хватило."

А ты мне опять со своим вот этим, иди суетись дальше, это твоё распределение, это твой путь и твой горизонт познания и ощущения твоей природы, он несоизмеримо мелок по сравнению с моим, понимаешь?

Я был на этой планете бесконечным множеством, и круче Цезаря, и круче Гитлера, и круче всех великих, понимаешь, был, а где-то был конченым говном, ещё хуже, чем здесь. Я множество этих состояний чувствую. Где-то я был больше подобен растению, где-то я больше был подобен птице, там, червю, где-то был просто сгусток камня, это всё есть душа, понимаешь?

193275300,1745251143,False,The worse game i ever played because its full of hackers valve do nothing and they ban people without any reason and they dont even want do discuss about it they just give u ban and that all and they dont take the ban away but hackers they dont ban....better said they dont care about the game anymore they care only fro money
193273946,1745250012,False,"many many times....the game kicks me after found the premier/comptetive matches, then starts the download updates, and bans me to play for a while because i cant enter the current game without download the updates. bruh trash game..."
193273408,1745249569,True,"Contains alot of cheaters but very fun, when you are lucky enough to play with legit players. Can also do for example face it which is a website with own anticheat to get pass this problem"
193272264,1745248621,True,"Knowing Valve's disdain for the number 3, this is most likely the final game in the series. Rest in Peace, CS3."
193270074,1745246729,True,It's not source or 1.6 but you can definitely relive some of the memories here. Especially on hostage maps. Unfortunately riddled with toxicity but there's a mute all button for that occasion!
193268373,1745245302,True,"Unfortunately, when you create a new Steam account and want to play CS 2, it is very difficult to level up because you are only playing against hackers."
193267030,1745244054,True,"Game is perfect, nice skins, u feel amazing while destroying other team and seeing them cry. But then in next half of the match u gonna see who is mentally limited and who is gonna start cheating. Hate them but game itself is kinda good."
193262847,1745240127,True,"Simple, balanced and effective game mechanics. With graphics from the Source 2 engine it looks amazing while still allowing for high frames per second.    It has been my go-to first person shooter this past year, my remedy against the current video game landscape overflowing with over-saturated games full of pay-to-win mechanics and advertisements for DLCs.    THANK YOU Minh Le for making this game, to Valve for the continuous work at improving the game and adding minimal but gameplay enhancing changes when necessary and to the CS community for the beautiful  maps and weapons skins."
193262477,1745239748,True,Overall good game but cs:go was waay bettter than this. Graphics are good and I like being called a faggot every game by 3 russian drunk men and 1 polish 10 year old

Powered by the Source 2 engine, CS2 aims to modernize the tactical FPS experience without losing its core identity. The result? A slicker, faster, and more reactive game — but not without its growing pains."
193253506,1745229135,True,It uis an amazing sequel to the original and it is still good to this day. 100% recommend it
193250068,1745224050,True,Still one of the best shooters out there. It does need a way to deal with cheaters better though...
193249252,1745222766,True,It is the best game as long as you hate your life and hate going outside
193241104,1745211775,False,Full of cheaters shooting you through walls and smokes. Devs don't ban or punish cheaters at all. VAC is a joke. Prime is full of cheaters
193237478,1745206250,True,"CS2 has potential,but it still feels like CSGO was better overall.The game suffers from too many cheaters right now, which really hurts the experience."
193235155,1745203103,False,"just save your time and effort, they really don't care about the gameplay anymore and only about milking the rest of the cashcow they developed over the years with this game. It was a great game just my time to put it down. You are better off investing your time and money into a far less lucrative game/platform imo"
193232863,1745200091,True,its fun except for when you gotta push mid with a shottie
193230956,1745197593,True,"very nice.  used to play csgo in high school and was a really big fan of it, but when i came to see it had a big revamp and is now Cs2, at first i had mixed feelings but since putting more hours into it im starting to love it again even though there is still the same old issues but ill look past them for now"
193229795,1745196064,False,the state the game is in right now is umbearable. tha ammount of cheaters is astonishing. every 1-2 games with elo above (7000 premier / gold nova 2 ) there is at least 1 cheater. PLS GABEN GIVE US KERNEL LEVEL ANTI-CHEAT ! IM BEGGING YOU GABE !  if you are looking forward to playing this game reconsider your choices or just play Faceit.

193223985,1745188926,False,fix ur game nx i try turn on and it crashes on looading screen wtf is this kurwa
193223302,1745188206,False,"former source & csgo player, never that high in comp rankings but a fairly decent shooter when matchmaking was balanced and definitely more of an entry frag style player. there's something about this iteration which just feels off, and I can't quite put my finger on it. I get rubberbanding pretty often which obviously isn't good for a competitive game, something I don't remember ever happening in csgo other than the occasional spurts of server lag which everyone experienced at the same time. I'll edit this review if it gets fixed.   the game feels like it should be really good, I'm just not enjoying it. It's a polished version of csgo in nearly every way. I don't know if it's because I've just gotten too bored of games these days, but it feels like the player base have all started injecting estrogen. there's no real laughter or hazing, people on casual are all really sweaty and have the shift key taped down and everyone's just taking it too seriously. they did in csgo to a lesser degree but it was always in good spirit. either I'm too old now or this iteration is just the next step towards being fully e-sports oriented?   that would be fair enough, and I'll keep playing every so often because of nostalgia and also to test myself, but my idea of a game is to have fun and for that reason I wouldn't recommend to new players. if you're just looking for fun, go find another game."
193223077,1745187960,True,hackers in 3/10 matches non faceit...still playable game i guess
193220894,1745185781,False,Literally the worst Counter-Strike ever made. CSGO had its issues but this is an absolute SHIT show in comparison. Micro-stutters out the ass. An insanely worse competitive system and experience in general. Shit hit reg. Wouldn't recommend for people old or new to the series. And seeing the 2000 hours I put in CSGO show up when I play this game just pisses me off. Thanks Valve. This game shows that even if you did do a Half-Life 3 you would just fuck it up like this trash can game.
193219717,1745184582,False,"The blatant cheaters and bot farms alone would make this worthy of a one star review. But then there's also problems with ping difference, movement, etc... And I haven't even mentioned the predatory skin market.  Used to have fun with this game, but I've decided I'm done playing."
193219271,1745184181,True,"As an Indonesian gamer, I really enjoy playing CS2. The graphics are much better than CS:GO, and the new mechanics make the game feel fresh. The server connection in Southeast Asia is decent, but sometimes there's a bit of lag. Still, the gameplay is super intense and competitive, which I love. The anticheat is weak and sometimes you can encounter cheaters. It’s great to see how Valve is improving the game — I’m excited to see more updates in the future!"
193219117,1745184015,True,"What I love about Counter-Strike 2 is how it manages to feel both fresh and familiar at the same time. From the first round, you can tell Valve really poured love into this upgrade. The new engine makes everything look so clean and crisp—maps I’ve played a hundred times now feel brand new, with lighting and detail that actually affect how I play.    But it’s not just about the looks. The gunplay is tighter than ever. Every shot feels responsive, every peek feels smoother, and when you land that perfect headshot... man, it's still the most satisfying feeling in any shooter. The dynamic smoke grenades blew my mind the first time I saw them react to gunfire or a HE grenade. It actually adds new layers of strategy and timing that weren’t there before.    I also love how streamlined the UI and matchmaking have become. It's faster to get into games, easier to track your rank and progress, and overall just feels more modern. Whether I’m sweating in comp, vibing in casuals, or messing around with friends on custom maps, CS2 keeps me coming back.    At its core, CS2 is everything I’ve always loved about CS—but polished, updated, and ready for the next era. It’s competitive, it’s intense, and it’s just plain addicting."
193212984,1745178405,True,Really good game I reccomend it to anybody that likes shoting games. There are a loot of cheaters in non-prime but prime is only 15 dollars so you shloud be good!
193212399,1745177889,False,"Game is so bad, u dont know where to start, russian/ukrainski cheaters/subtick/ random bullets flying just not where u aim. valve wants us to open cases rest is not that important."

193208281,1745174312,True,"It's like playing old school CS, but with updated graphics. Everything just seems better all round, without ruining the feel at all. A++ would recommend."
193203731,1745170537,True,good game but the cheaters and the trash anti cheat system ruins everything
193202252,1745169225,True,Cool game but too many cheaters unfortunately !

193195916,1745164004,False,"Long time veteran of franchise. This went to shit some time ago. The game is full of cheaters, people who do not want to communicate in English or spam some other language in voice chat all the time. Tick rate and peeker's advantage make the game unplayable from time to time. Sometimes you get dragged to your death behind a corner because of bad tick rate and how the game registers hits."

193181644,1745151252,False,"Dieses Spiel, CS2, ist eine absolute Katastrophe. Seit dem ersten Tag, an dem ich Prime gekauft habe, wimmelt es in jedem einzelnen Match nur so von Cheatern. Es ist schlichtweg unmöglich, seinen Trust Factor zu verbessern, weil man ständig gegen Betrüger spielen muss. Die Spielerfahrung ist dadurch komplett ruiniert. Valve muss hier dringend etwas unternehmen, denn so ist das Spiel unspielbar"
193181628,1745151238,False,"this game not worth to buy prime / play the game for now, theres so much Cheater on Premier / Competitive game.  i was playing more than 50 games compe & premier, and some player will be 60% on the game is cheating. even last day i play cheater vs cheater. Its makes me not enjoying this game anymore. its so sad the report system is not works."

193172660,1745141351,False,This game has been out for 13 years and it still has hackers. The game is a money laundering scheme with a gambling side hustle.

193160648,1745126588,False,Cheater Strike 2 Every game you will get a cheater when you are playing this game on so called vac secured servers. Don't play it unless you are masochist or rock bottom and get some cash from case drops. Good luck with your choices.
193157641,1745122921,True,very fun. community can be a little toxic to new players but if you get over that its a very good game

193145683,1745107982,True,"Alright, so today is the third day of me playing this game. What can I say about it?    • Well, I found 4 cheaters by now - 3 wall hacks and 1 aimbot.  • Playing competitive; more than a half of players are pro's on smurf accounts.  -""So what"", you may ask?  So it's either my team getting obliterated without me able to do anything about it, or enemy team being absolutely destroyed while 3/5 of our players cant get a single frag in a round. I can't say if there is anything competitive about the ""competitive"".  • There is no pay to win, but seeing all these skins, stickers and graffiti (which look absolutely damn horrible) either in promos or in game is disgusting. Nothing breaks the vibe as much as these rainbow colored skins and bright cartoonish agents.  Oh, and by the way - where are all the map-related T and CT models from CS:GO?  • Not as much maps as I thought there would be. Even CSS had more official maps than this.    All in all - I already hate this game. So much trouble for almost no enjoyment... [i]Or maybe...[/i]  [i]I remember that one time I did some sick headshots on dust... Or one other match where I... [/i]  Ok - f#!k it - I think I'm up for another match."

193138374,1745101173,True,"After playing for almost 2.500+ hours with multiple accounts, i think it's safe to say that this game is just for surfing or fun servers. The creators or admins do not care about servers or competitive matches. My last 4 out of 5 matches were crawling with cheaters and i'm not just being salty or toxic. They're laughing and openly cheating and don't give a damn about their actions. They play with %100 headshot ratio and i'm writing ""you know this can easily detected by even a bot right?"" and they say ""nope, we're playing like this for almost 4 weeks and no one notice :D"". So basicly just for ""fun"" purposes, yeah this game can playable. But if you really want to play competitive, either play different game like valorant or rainbow 6 siege, or use face it or some other platform. I repeat ""DO NOT USE THEIR OWN MATCHMAKING SYSTEM BECAUSE VALVE IS HIRING PLAIN DUMBS OR BLIND PEOPLE TO WATCH COMPETITIVE MATCHES"". Thank you for reading."

193116454,1745081910,True,"🌟 ""CS2: The King is Back — And He Brought a Nuke"" 🌟  226 hours on record | Still feels like Day 1    Counter-Strike 2 isn’t just a game. It’s an addiction, an obsession, and a battlefield where milliseconds decide legends.    Valve has taken everything we love about CS:GO and turned the dials to 11. Cleaner, crisper graphics. Lightning-fast servers. Sub-tick responsiveness so tight it feels like your thoughts are hitting headshots before your mouse moves. Every round feels like a cinematic experience — every clutch is a heartbeat away from glory or heartbreak.    The gunplay? Still the best in the world. Nothing hits like a crisp AK one-tap or an AWP flick that echoes into eternity. And now, with upgraded smokes that are volumetric and dynamic (yes, they react to nades and bullets), even utility usage is its own mind game.    Tired of rinse-and-repeat shooters with bloated mechanics? CS2 strips it down to pure, refined tactical skill. You outsmart, outshoot, and outlast. It's not just about reactions — it’s about discipline, strategy, and ice in your veins.    Whether you’re a silver trying to climb or a seasoned veteran chasing 5-stack glory, CS2 rewards dedication like no other.    💣 The tension of a 1v4 clutch. 💥 The rush of breaking onto site with milliseconds to plant. 🔥 The symphony of utility, aim, and team comms in perfect harmony.    This game doesn’t hold your hand — it raises your standards.    CS2 isn’t just worth playing. It’s worth mastering.    👏 Download it. Queue up. And welcome to the proving grounds."

193082870,1745049131,True,"Title: A Worthy Successor – CS2 Raises the Bar!  Counter-Strike 2 is everything fans hoped for and more. Valve has taken the classic tactical gameplay we all know and love and polished it to a shine with stunning Source 2 engine visuals, improved responsiveness, and smoother mechanics.  The updated graphics bring a fresh look to familiar maps without compromising the competitive integrity that makes CS special. Smokes are now dynamic and interact with the environment, adding a whole new layer of strategy. Movement feels tighter, shooting feels more responsive, and the matchmaking system has seen noticeable improvements.  What really stands out is how Valve managed to modernize the game without losing the soul of CS:GO. It still feels like Counter-Strike – just sharper, smarter, and more immersive.  Whether you're a veteran or a newcomer, CS2 offers an intense, rewarding, and endlessly replayable experience. It’s not just a game – it's the competitive shooter. 10/10."

So the only conclusion is that Steam wants this game to die."
193077439,1745041827,True,CS2 is a secret gambling simulator.   If you're not opening each and every case - you are losing out on the endgame potential.     Better odds at hitting these slots than the IRL casino.

I left the game two years ago because of this issue, but I recently created a new account, hoping that Valve and Steam had taken it seriously. Unfortunately, nothing has changed—in fact, the situation has worsened. The problem with hackers remains just as bad, if not worse than before.      I am deeply saddened to see such an iconic game—one that many of us grew up playing and holds a significant place in our childhood—being ruined by this issue. I can’t understand why this hasn’t been properly addressed unless there’s only one possible explanation: that you are actually creating these cheats and selling them for extra profit. If that’s the case, shame on you!"

192927272,1744878736,True,Hackers literally make the game unplayable and until they do something about it you're better off going and playing Valorant (even if the abilites are not your thing) Just because you know the people you are facing are legit or atleast have a good chance of not cheating since their anti-cheat works :/ sucks aswell this game is really fun and the games where i actually dont run into any cheaters are really some of the most fun i've had in FPS games in along time.
192924535,1744875954,True,"I never understood the appeal of this game when it first came out asides from the possible money making aspect it has. I was primarily an Xbox kid and the only FPS games I had ever played were CoD and Halo, so I had no nostalgia for Counter Strike or anything from Valve that wasn't included in the OrangeBox. When I first got this game I got it in a bundle alongside every other CS game and it sat in my steam library for over 7 years. It wasn't until recently when a friend asked me to get on where I actually played the game for the first time and I can finally say... I get it. This game legit has me addicted and I don't even know why? It's so outside my typical formula of games I like to play and yet for some reason I can't stop playing? Am I seriously too far gone, is there something chemically wrong inside my body that's making me enjoy this game? This games VAC is so horrible I play with Blatant cheaters in Premier and yet for some odd reason I still like this game.  It's free now, so you're not really hurting yourself by downloading it, so might as well..."

Античит - больная проблема, которая так и не была пофикшена.  Премьер режим - похож на парад прокаженных, те кто играют в него поймут почему.

192842883,1744773767,True,"CS2 brings the legendary Counter-Strike formula into the modern era with improved graphics, responsive movement, and slick new smoke mechanics. The Source 2 engine really elevates the feel of the game — everything looks sharper and runs smoother (depending on your rig).  That said, it’s not without its issues. Some legacy features are missing, the new UI can feel clunky, and there are occasional bugs or hit-reg frustrations. Matchmaking is still a mixed bag, and community servers/mods are somewhat limited compared to CS:GO (for now)."
192837872,1744766699,True,"Overall nice game, apart from the cheaters this is the best FPS in the world without a doubt.All though that cheater part is hard to ignore, once you get over 10K on Premier they start being less noticed, i guess i cant say the game is bad purely because of the cheaters, + the whole skin and trading scene is massive and very nice."

They have 100% accurate bhop, know everything, and shooting magic bullets. 3.J3k (Normal Form) – No brain, no aim—just noodles. Constantly talking to their friend in team voice chat, and no one understands a word. 4.The Valorant Player – Only here to say how bad this game is and quit. Refuses to play anything but their own game. Always getting one-tapped with pre-aim or can’t control the AK spray pattern then start screaming aimbot (Ye VAC suc We knew)"
192819926,1744745304,True,I like to play it. It's nice to see the improvements and changes over the years of CS from 1.6. Legend of a FPS shooter and the skins introduction to the game was a fun experience.
192817643,1744743070,False,"its just a shallow copy of csgo. Besides graphics - whole game is a downgrade. Scamtick - u run u win, holding angle is mission impossible, bhop impossible, every action is delayed. Valve simply wanted to save money and stay at 64tick, so we got this. Same situation with VAC, they developed AI anti cheat - wich is completley useless. For past month every 5th game Ive played had cheater on enemy team or mine or both. Guys where shooting thick walls with AWP, insta HS - but its too hard for AI VAC to detect it, Ive seen guys with knifes and gloves who use aim trigger. The state of the game is a joke. Like in csgo days 5 cheaters per year was maximum, but now they even fak up the trust factor so no matter if u have skins or not, how long u play, 25k rating or 15k rating - u will get cheaters.     Ok lets imagine u dont see cheaters, and u so noob that scamtick doesnt annoy u - game didnt have any content since launch, 90% csgo game modes are still not ported, surf dead, kz dead, custom servers in general just dead. ALL WE HAVE IS A CASINO, GJ VALVE!"

192804535,1744730599,True,"As a longtime fan of the Counter-Strike franchise, Counter-Strike 2 feels like a solid modernization of the iconic tactical shooter. Powered by the Source 2 engine, the visual upgrade is immediately noticeable — maps look cleaner, lighting is dynamic, and character models are more detailed without losing that classic CS identity.  What I liked:  Improved visuals and physics: The upgraded graphics make the game feel fresh, especially on legacy maps like Dust2 and Mirage. Smoke grenades are now volumetric and reactive to environment and gunfire, which adds a new layer of strategy.  Performance: Despite the graphical overhaul, the game runs smoothly even on mid-tier machines.  Hit registration and movement: These feel more consistent and fluid compared to CS:GO, especially with sub-tick updates.  UI/UX overhaul: The main menu, scoreboard, and buy menu have all been refreshed and are more intuitive.  What I disliked:  Missing features at launch: Some features from CS:GO, like certain community maps, weapon skins, or modes, were initially absent or buggy. It's improving with updates, but the launch felt incomplete.  Matchmaking issues: Ranked play still needs polish. There are occasional long queue times and questionable matchmaking decisions.  Learning curve: Like all CS games, it’s brutally punishing for newcomers. There’s no real onboarding or tutorial — you either learn by fire or get left behind.  Final Thoughts: Counter-Strike 2 doesn’t reinvent the wheel — and it doesn’t need to. It builds on the tight gameplay foundation of CS:GO and brings the franchise into a new era. It’s not perfect, but for fans of tactical shooters, it’s definitely worth playing.  Recommended? Yes, especially for CS veterans. New players might need some patience, but the gameplay depth is unmatched once you get the hang of it."

It’s also a great way to work on your aim. Plus, the case opening system is a fun extra if you’ve got a bit of money to spend, and also if you like competitive more play face it or premier.    Thanks :)"

192783790,1744703800,False,"I gave Valve money so I could play the game without being paired with cheaters. Despite that, I have encountered an incomprehensible number of cheaters, and even more smurfs lately. As I write this, I am currently in a game with 3 actual wall-hackers. The odds of that happening are so incredibly low, unless the games anti-cheat just doesn't work (it doesn't). FACEIT does a much better job of assuring that you don't get matched with cheaters. Yeah- a 3rd party app does a better job than this billion dollar industry. If a game's reliability and legitimacy has to rely on a 3rd party software to maintain the life of the game, then there are some serious problems that need fixing."

Every match confirm intense one — must use strategy, aim properly, and teamwork is super important.  The guns all got pattern wan, so you cannot just simply shoot. You need to learn how to control the recoil, then only can play well. Map also very classic — Dust2, Mirage, all still very popular.  But ah, not so easy for beginner. First time play, maybe you kena headshot non-stop. But slowly slowly you learn, then can carry your team also. Got many toxic players sometimes, but if you play with friends, more shiok.  Graphics not the best lah, but no need fancy graphics — gameplay solid already. Plus, the competitive scene quite strong, got many tournaments, Malaysia also got some pro players.  Overall, if you like shooting games, CS:GO is still one of the best. Can play for years and still won't boring."
192705186,1744593696,True,"the game is really really good and fun to play, and has many interesting features just wish they would upgrade their anti cheat so that they aren't a lot of cheaters, the reputation of the game is slowly, slowly declining as everyone thinks everyone is a cheater, other than that the game is great you'll enter a few cheater lobbies then all will be good."
192701482,1744588593,False,I would have 100% recommended this game if it were anything like CS:GO.. CS2 has completely ruined the game. Terrible anti-cheat and functions of the game need work. Should have kept this game in beta until it was fully complete. Wish i could go back to CS:GO again.

192679385,1744566186,False,"Well, I really like to play simple game after long working hours. But the game became unplayable for many reasons. A lot of cheaters on casual games, random hit boxes, but most annoying of all, VAC failures. Imagine in the middle of the game you're kicked because Valve couldn't do some stuff in the background. And then there's no easy way to restart the game, you should try many things to see which one will help you to start the game again. That's it, that was my last play. It was fun journey but it must end now, because I don't want to spend 30 minutes trying to restart the game because the game couldn't verify the files"

192672409,1744560298,True,"Counter-Strike 2 has arrived as a breath of fresh air, yet also a familiar friend. As someone who's been deeply invested in the Counter-Strike series for the past 25 years, it's incredible to reflect on the journey from the humble beginnings of the original mod to this latest iteration. The core gameplay mechanics—precise aiming, strategic teamwork, and the iconic maps—remain refreshingly intact, serving as a testament to the timeless quality of Counter-Strike's gameplay formula.  Playing CS2 with my real-life friends continues to be an unparalleled experience. The excitement of coordinating a well-executed strategy, the adrenaline rush during clutch situations, and the camaraderie built through countless matches remain unmatched by any other gaming experience. Valve has managed to enhance visuals and refine gameplay mechanics subtly yet significantly, making CS2 feel modern and responsive without sacrificing the classic feel that long-time fans like myself cherish.  However, despite these positives, one persistent issue continues to cast a shadow over the overall experience—cheating. Valve has historically struggled with managing cheaters, and unfortunately, this issue has persisted into Counter-Strike 2. It's disheartening to encounter players who exploit hacks, ruining matches that would otherwise be exciting and fair competitions. My enjoyment, and that of my friends, is frequently diminished due to these negative experiences.  Furthermore, Valve's Trust Factor system, which is meant to reduce these encounters, hasn't been as effective as I'd hoped. Despite playing clean and consistently positive behavior, I find myself matched against suspicious opponents far too frequently. Enhancing the accuracy and responsiveness of the Trust Factor system would greatly improve the overall matchmaking experience, encouraging fair play and maintaining the integrity of the competitive scene.  In conclusion, Counter-Strike 2 represents both a beautiful evolution of the franchise and a significant opportunity for Valve to address longstanding issues. After 25 years, my passion for this game remains strong, driven by friendship and the enduring thrill of competitive play. Yet, Valve's action on combating cheating and refining the Trust Factor system could genuinely elevate Counter-Strike 2 from great to extraordinary. Here's hoping they rise to the occasion."

The removal of map based factions is just pure laziness. there’s way more cheaters, and they’ve done absolutely nothing about it. Sure, the graphics are technically better, but for some reason I think GO looked way better. Not to mention the gunplay feels so off. GO felt way more tight and responsive, and just had more soul. I just wish playing CS:GO was still an option and they didn’t just take it off the fucking store. That being said, still  fun, just not as fun as GO."

192576190,1744462398,False,"CS2 is turning out to be a huge letdown. I was all hyped for the upgrade, but honestly, it feels like the devs just axed a ton of the features that made the old games so much fun. Remember surfing, hide and seek, and those epic zombie maps? Gone. And with the community browser missing too, it's like all those cool custom games and mods we used to dive into are just history.  On top of that, the cheater issue still isn't fixed. It's 2025, and the anti-cheat system is still not up to par this ruins the competitive vibe completely. The game feels wonky overall, with clunky movement and weird physics, making matches feel more like a beta test than a polished product.  I get that change is inevitable and the devs might be trying to push for something new, but they’ve tossed out the stuff that gave us a unique community vibe. Hopefully, future patches address these problems and maybe even bring back some of the lost features. As it stands, CS2 feels like it's lost its soul, and that’s a real shame for longtime fans."

192553253,1744435773,True,Good game if you don't run into hackers or little squeakers
192546246,1744426535,True,Great game but hackers are still holding it back from being a best of all time for me. Other shooters have done a better job with anti-cheat.
192545944,1744426152,False,This game is full of cheaters. And it will continue unless people will stop buying cases and keys. Valve stopped caring about this game a long time ago . It's pure money grabber. They exploit the game popularity and peoples gambling addiction to make profit out of it.
192544599,1744424492,True,"i love counter strike 2. i love the gameplay, i love the mechanics, i love the maps (NUKE IS MY GOAT).  the people on the game are sometimes funny but most of the time, they are just racist and homophobic.   either way good game, sometimes bad community, but a simple mute and never talking usually makes people not bother me.  great job valve, y'all did awesome"

192522024,1744398888,False,"I'm going to be honest here, right now counter strike 2 is unplayable. I cannot play a single game without a cheater killing me, I constantly feel like im playing on 30 ping, im convinced subtick is a complete failure due to how shit the hitreg seems to be    If there was a game that could replicate the core mechanics and feel of cs, I'd immediately jump the ship."

192512705,1744390334,False,"This game is absolute trash. I used to play CS back in the day competitively, and this supposed ""new and improved"" version 2 is absolute dogshit. Good job murdering the re-release of a classic. I thought that was supposed to be Microsoft and Blizzard's job.  R.I.P. Counterstrike, you gave STEAM birth and were one of the greatest games of all time. I'm glad to have known you well before this atrocity of mediocrity."
192508351,1744386381,False,I constantly get comp cooldowns because the game crashes and gets stuck at 0% downloading content at launch. Skin collecting program with a comp mode as a side quest. what a joke.
192506807,1744385020,False,I came from Valorant and fell in love with CS2's  gunplay. But cheaters are EVERYWHERE! The game is almost perfect.  VALVE please fix the GAME! If my review gets removed it means that reviews are rigged.

192502348,1744380875,True,"This game is FPS genre defining. The game play mechanics and strategies are just so unique and have never been replicated. The game is incredibly simple but its simplicity is what has made it stand the test of time. Easy for new players to pick up but a skill ceiling that reaches to the moon. A history book of video games would be incomplete without a chapter on Counter Strike. 500 hours at the time of writing, still bad, still accuse people that are better than me of hacking, can't recommend it enough."
192501771,1744380341,True,You either have bots or cheaters very nice 10/10 best game

192451281,1744312868,False,"Too much cheaters who uses it recreationally and evan mock enemies for that. Don't even want to talk about wh that they are using in winning decision rounds. VAC working 2 months in year and half and valve cant fix it for good, instead they are focusing on some updates that make games even worse where guy shoot 2 meatrs away from you and kills you or even shot at your leg and get a headshots so game getting worse and worse instead of getting better. In old CS 1.6 there were at least admins on servers who were using amx commands to ban kids with cheats. So going back to old better version of CS"
192450765,1744312365,True,very funny people in this game sometimes and the gameplay is just fenomenol

192445972,1744307798,False,"Absoloutly broken game, VAC doesn't work... the cheaters are in almost every game!!"

192437777,1744300268,True,An enjoyable journey.  I've been around for a while hopping in and out quite a game =)
192436735,1744299305,False,"Ever since they switched to Counter strike 2 the game has been awful. I will preface with the fact that I've played CS 1.6, CS Source and CS:GO, so this is in no way coming from a place of simply hating the new game. I never felt this way switching from any of the other games. Sadly this is simply because CS2 is the worst iteration of the game since Condition Zero.  In CS:GO you had responsive movement and cohesive mechanics that were consistent at all times.  CS2 Has taken a massive step backwards in the evolution of the game.  The sub-tick system they've been very keen on showing off has only had negative results associated with it. It makes the game feel less responsive and that in turn creates problems with the gameplay and gun play.  The game feels less like a game you become better at with time, and moreso a very RNG game with little to no skill curve and lower skill ceiling, especially since they made the SMGs extremely overpowered which has shifted the game towards way more of a run and gun shooter.  And this is excluding all the game breaking smaller bugs that have plagued the game since launch. Those are simply to many to count. And I wont delve deeper but I will finish by saying that the cheating problem has never been more severe and problematic. It is quite literally impossible to play the game for an entire day and not encounter hackers.   All of this, paired with no real updates, no new features, no new content and absolutely no anti-cheat, CS2 is by far the worst Valve product in years.  If you are thinking of getting into CS. Don't, simply just don't do it. This is sadly a dumpsterfire with no end in sight."
192433316,1744296129,False,the worst game i ever played because lots of cheater and dumb people. i dont recomend play this fuckibng stupid game
192431427,1744294304,False,Dont install it only retard teammates its very rare to get someone good or to not be Russian
192431368,1744294251,True,I love this game although theres still a bunch of players who uses third party software but anyhow its great👍👍
192428975,1744291715,True,some russian players are dumb asf with 1 braincell and calls you a *blyat* 10/10 game tho
192427777,1744290408,True,"niet, uninstall, only pidars cheaters , goodgame"
192423642,1744285566,False,this game is the definition of pain. ever fucking match i get queued with fucking brain dead russians who blast hard bass on their mic or curse in russian the whole fucking game.The matchmaking is laughable i was gold nova 3 and i got 10 match losing streak that got me to fucking silver 3 like for the love of god fix your match making and what where you thinking with the premier gamemode please bring back the old system nobody likes it like dude you had something that was working and you ruined it in cs2. OH and before i forger please for crying out loud fix your fucking anti-cheat every game there is at least one guy cheating (silver lobbies)
192422439,1744283897,True,"Solid game, devs could make improvements to anti-cheat"
192418242,1744277774,True,"Good game, subtick could be better but its fine."
192413892,1744270414,False,"Never thought I'd write a review for this game, but here we are! Let's take a trip down memory lane - I first played this back in high school when dial-up internet was still a thing. Oh, how far we've come! While the graphics might seem dated compared to modern titles, they've improved leaps and bounds since those early days.    Remembering those dial-up struggles still gives me PTSD - one phone call and BAM! Instant disconnect from the game. Those were the days...    But here's why I can't recommend this game today: the community has become absolutely toxic over its 25-year lifespan. I remember when local net cafes hosted Counter-Strike tournaments with actual sportsmanship and prizes. That friendly competition is long gone.    Now when I log on (with my sadly diminished reflexes), all I find is a cesspool of trash talk, screaming matches, and players tearing each other apart over every mistake. Gaming should be competitive but fun - this is just miserable. The community has turned into something truly awful, sucking all enjoyment out of what was once a great experience.    Verdict: A nostalgic relic that's been ruined by its own player base."
192412575,1744267982,False,"Yeah, everything non-Faceit is you get cheater like 4 out of 5 games.  Valve need some new invented US law to start to finally taken actions against cheaters. If you really think this organization care about unfair cheating players, you must be dumb :D  Basically cheating in CS is like taking doping in mma, for example. Which is making game pointless.  I used wallhack one time in my life in CS 1.6 (yeah, around 2004 year) and remember making pistol ace. Everybody was like Wow man, but I was disgusted inside and never used it again because something felt off. And... somebody doing this on a daily basis and Valve praising it. How even possible?  This is basically non-regulated on a law level and thats why cs2 people and Valve think this is normal and getting away with this. There are TON options (including AI detection) to solve the problem, but for 12 years literally ZERO has been done."
192412488,1744267760,False,"unplayable game riddled with wallhacker and aimbotters. VAClife doesnt do shit, and the game is unplayable with this many cheaters"
192409158,1744261463,True,good game overall. Maybe sometimes is a little bit off but i like it.
192404483,1744253547,True,"Very enjoyable game-play you can also learn Russian or Chinese while playing. The community is very welcoming, they gave lots of tips on how to uninstall the game and kill myself. Would recommend. You will find less cheaters on Tinder."
192402649,1744250848,True,"this game is great, i personally tk every teammate i had and was laughing my booty off, and i also kissed a lot of  men here/"
192401240,1744248784,False,"This will hurt the fat single dads left on this game, but CS2 is complete and utter dogshit and it's absolutely NO WONDER a game like VALORANT is more alive than this shit. Valve has lost its mind with this game.     Period point blank, if you own a OLED monitor, this game will absolutely crash, A LOT. When CS2 came out it was really exciting to get to experience CS with high end graphics that my machine more than supports. This game will crash, crash, then crash some more. NO MATTER what I do, what resolution I am on, what settings I use, no amount of ""-novolumetrics -dx11 -disable_d3d9ex -nojoy -noubershader +fps_max 240 -refresh 240 -fullscreen"" makes this shit stay open for longer than 5 minutes. I have tried everything to fix it and it comes down to this game not being properly optmized which is hilarious in 2025. You know what game doesn't crash? VALORANT.    CS2 is a glorified gambling sim and the only reason there's players left at all is because Valve doesn't know what to do with the multi-million dollar economy they created from cases, which even with that they hardly put out anything. These fat neckbeardian lifers of this game like to point to Riot and say BUT MUH DATA BUT THE INVASIVE ANTI CHEAT!!!! At least VALORANT has a working fucking anti-cheat. I have friends who have cheated for YEARS on CSGO and onward into CS2. It's borderline allowed. Which leaves you with the option to play on dogshit Faceit servers, which oh boy, some third party company thatis definitely being safe with the very data you think multibillion dollar company Riot isn't being safe with.    This game is only nostalgia, is propped up by the whitest, fattest, most basement dwelling fringe group online, and like EVERY other Valve game is just a overrated piece of shit game that isn't held to the standards we hold LITERALLY every other game.     Also Valve has been caught stealing data, selling it, etc more times than Riot ever has or will.     Google is free, fuck this game, fuck you."
192399728,1744246534,True,"Great game, play with friend, have fun but, sometimes have some toxic player"
192399486,1744246231,True,"this game is amazing but i have to say a few things... i played this game before and had several hundred hours and got vac banned but made another account and now i can play again, however i got addicted AGAIN. this game has made me shit myself more than i can count. probably like 13 times or something but anyway. i like this game. do not open cases its a scam but instead you can buy red phosphorus, hydroiodic acid, and pseudo tablets. mix them together, boil in a flask at 180 degrees C for 8 hrs. then poor the mixture onto a try and bake in an oven for about 6 hrs. then let it cool and then you can either smoke it or sell the product for a very high price! then you can buy yourself all the knifes in the game with steam giftcards, then use a third party site to sell your skins to get cash money into your bank account without being traced by the IRS because it is tecniclly gambling winnings because you used the third party site to transfer the skins into real money. ANYWAYS this game is really good, highly reccomend."
192397329,1744243213,False,"This game anti cheat's is effective as horny 14yo teenager trying to pull out in his first time..  You simply can not play without a 3rd party software that actually works and ban cheaters..  Badly optimized compared to older versions, you have to make more than 30 tweaks in pc tunning to get a fair inputlag"
192394323,1744239104,False,"You encouter cheaters so often during your own matches or after reviewing them, that the game becomes frustrating to play. You even start doubting actual good players. Whenever you sense the slightest hint of unfairness the game becomes less enjoying because you never know if it is just another cheater or just a good player.  In addition to that, Valve seems to be unwilling to change the situation that has been present basically since the CS2 release. The only notable changes seem to be more cash grabs."
192394312,1744239098,True,Very fun and cool game Dont like the amount of cheaters i play against tho.
192392374,1744236600,False,"Valve does not care about this game valve does not ban cheaters in this game, valve does not want to bring overwatch back to the game to atleast let us ban cheaters. Therefore this game should not be recommended to other players."
192392218,1744236380,True,good game FACEIT wouldnt connect but after getting prime not cheaters every game good game if you have the money to spend on prime.
192388641,1744232214,True,"Counter-Strike is hands down one of the best competitive shooters out there. The gameplay is smooth, tactical, and always keeps you on your toes. Whether you're clutching a 1v5 or just messing around with friends, it never gets old. A true classic that still feels fresh every time I play."
192381886,1744225149,True,"Most of the Problems with gamefeel are down to the changes in subtick. the game isn't broken, it's *different*. people will adjust and the world will be right again"
192378984,1744222273,False,Valve does not care about this game or players for that mater. full of cheaters 9 out of 10 games there is a obvious cheater or two. Scams are rampant and they could give back scammed items but they dont care if you. shit game
192378037,1744221307,True,its a fun game imo. before always played valorant but CS2 feels just soo much smoother. The only bad thing about this game is the non existing anti-cheat. and the dust 2 only players in premier xD
192375381,1744218800,False,"With playing this game, you also get private Russian and Ukrainian language lessons, which I do not recommend..."
192374450,1744217915,False,"dirty cheaters every other game, prime was a good investment."
192374347,1744217814,False,"This game is a joke crashing on your match not opening afterwards, get you banned and delete your points. Go ban the cheaters you idiots. Not recomended, steals your time and only makes you angry."
192370384,1744214009,False,way too many cheaters to even enjoy the game a bit. matchmaking is a joke and valve wont do anything about it genuinely a pathetic company that wont do anything about the cheating problem. valve are a awful company that genuinely don't care a about the player base and will only do things that will make them  a quick profit. no anti cheat. no help from the devs. and not one fuck given about the players
192366328,1744210219,False,Only casino updates. The last actual gameplay update was in November 2024 which added a ported map from CS:GO.  I miss when Valve made good games instead of shutting down mod projects and making money off of casino addicts.
192364308,1744208257,False,The game is good but Value has a shit anti cheat system just like ever two games there is a cheater and no matter how many times i report u cant get them banned and if they get banned you dont get your rank back

192332181,1744162877,True,"nicest game i've seen, the game market should look out what Valve has done over the years. Quite insane, not shot it has been one of the greatest games and esports in 10~years, a bit sad though that i just really started playing on 2025. enjoy and learn!"
192331424,1744161847,False,the most rage inducing game you'll ever play.     I somehow have come back for more...

192325660,1744154188,False,the games got way to many cheater bro im brand new and a very good shooter it makes no since what so ever i stand completely still and my recoil is ridiculous meanwhile people are sprinting and head tapping me with one bullet
192322867,1744150712,True,This game made me so depressed that i actually now enjoy playing it. CS2 caused my brain to hit the negative integer limit. 10/10

192318796,1744146039,False,"I’ve been playing CS since the 1.6 days — back when skill actually meant something. I was hyped for CS2, expecting a modern take on a classic. But damn… this game is straight-up unplayable. Every other round there’s a cheater teleporting, aimbotting, wallhacking — you name it. What’s the point of grinding, improving, or even playing legit when VAC is basically taking a nap?    I love this game at its core, but Valve seriously dropped the ball. CS2 feels more like Cheater Simulator 2 right now. Fix your anti-cheat or watch loyal, long-time players like me walk away — for good."
192311007,1744138295,True,"wanna shoot terrorists or police? fear of prisons? worry not, in this game you can legally shoot both pollice and terrorists, and its fun!!! play solo-que or team up with your friends in numerous of different gamemodes."

192274635,1744096477,True,"Wow, what a game. The skins are luxurious, the game play is satisfyingly mechanical and leaves you wishing you were more practiced, the players range from great to toxic. But man what a game.   ""This ain't the killing house anymore.""  GLHF"
192274563,1744096372,True,I love this game and I have played since my young age but valve should do something about the cheaters
192269849,1744088058,False,"Игра вообще не регает, регает только по тимейтам так что игра хуйня и читеров дофига"
192268999,1744086767,True,"Regardless of its up and down nature, I've always really enjoyed this franchise and fully believe the CS2 update has reinvigorated the game and added lots of quality of life and modernization, ultimately making the experience SO much more enjoyable. I look forward to booting the game up much more often than not."
192268297,1744085661,True,"Counter strike is like an abusive step father sometimes he might be nice to you, but most the time he will beat you. After a while you just wanna play any other game but the dopamine of the rare high moments keeps bringing you back, and before you know it you have an expensive knife, 500 hours, and a gambling addiction.  met some Russians and some other cool people. Overall 6/10 would hate my life again"

192252508,1744064935,True,hacker central but fun ig get better report system and get better anti cheat bro like its been out forever start banning  damnnnnnnnnnnn
192252161,1744064537,False,The lupus-infested cheaters in this game made a Vicodin overdose look like a great option. Wilson had to talk me out of it.
192251178,1744063351,False,"sharpest, no fluff, mechanics around. will get a good review as soon as they follow other games, and add a feature that globally mutes people who are being constantly muted and reported for voice abuse and harassment. the only way to play public matchmaking is to turn your teammates either almost all the way down or mute them beforehand. if people realize they wont be able to use voice chat if they keep being racist and toxic, then they will eventually stop yelling slurs. the fact the game just lets them keep being racist, reinforces their behavior.   we should stop giving CS the pass, just because its the best game ever. they need to fix their public experience. would evolve it beyond just a game if they focused on the community instead of weapon skins."
192246091,1744058027,True,I have spent large amounts money on skins but my friends who are utterly dogshit at the game get knives and 100$ skins
192242371,1744054420,True,From my experience as a not so high elo player there aren't that many cheaters. Tbh from what I have seen it's about the same as Valorant. Could be just me tho cuz i don't play it that much. Otherwise it's the upgrade we needed to CS:GO. Only if the cheating Is fixed for everyone and not just based on my luck It will be awesome.
192240412,1744052709,True,"Shit ass game, no gold for a brother and now my children are owned by a den of literal leeches.

192233380,1744046350,False,"Not Recommended (But I Still Play It Sometimes… Somehow)  I honestly don’t even know why I keep coming back to this game. It’s so unrealistic it’s almost funny. I sneak up behind someone, empty nearly a full AK-47 mag into their back, and they just turn around and one-tap me in the head 😂  Yes, yes, I know… I’m probably just a bad noob. But come on – a little bit of realism wouldn’t hurt, right?  If you enjoy pain, frustration, and questioning your life choices – this one’s for you."
192233140,1744046110,True,good game but.. the cowards choose to cheat and use hacks.
192233025,1744046006,False,Game servers suck and cheaters are rampant  but at least we got a new case

192226461,1744040215,True,"Great game, i've been playing for 10 hours and for now my experience is that:    - People dont have mics    - My entire team is somehow worse than one guy in enemy    - No info    Would i recommend? FUCK NO."
192219988,1744034687,False,"Leveling from level 1 to level 10 takes an insanely long amount of time, I want to play Premier with my friends, yet i cannot because i'm only level 5. A 30 minutes game hardly covers more than 1% towards getting to level 10.  Please be aware before you make the purchase as you will be stuck grinding to level 10 while facing hackers in games."

192212685,1744026977,True,"Despite my Steam acc saying i have 100 plus hours on CS i actually have over 1000++ hours on CSGO. When i turn 18 i could finally use steam without limit and could buy whatever i want on steam.  That being said, When Valve decided to make CSGO better i was looking forward to it. better graphics and some Smoke mechanics. it was pretty exciting. Until the day that i could grind CS:GO on my very own personal account. is the day Valve killed CS:GO. Also the day CS2 was born. And i can't enjoy the game as much as i did with CS:GO. I've reached Global and practice hard on community practice maps. but as cool as CS2 update was. Something about CS2 is missing that CSGO had.  SO CS2 is 6/10 for me. and CSGO is 8/10."
192207685,1744020099,True,"Best game......VALVE PLS fix ANTI CHEAT,u are a rich bi*ch buy Vanguard,and i love NiKo and m0nesy"

192201973,1744011573,True,"Counter-Strike 2 is a fantastic game with improved graphics, smoother gameplay, and great mechanics. It's really fun to play, especially with friends. However, the cheating problem is a serious issue that ruins the experience at times. If Valve can fix the anti-cheat system, this game could easily be one of the best competitive shooters out there."
192188568,1743991829,False,"thief of joy   I've been playing counter-strike since the year 2000 and always loved it, but CS2 just sucks"
192186437,1743989173,True,"Good game but has loads of cheaters in comp, its a little buggy but still a classic."
192183404,1743985362,False,This game is fun sometimes. Sadly there'll be many cheaters and cry babies when you play. Also ranked doesn't matter since those are where the cheaters are. The VAC system doesn't work very well.
192177264,1743978353,False,"Cheaters in petty much every game-     I got a 2nd account to play with my boyfriend who is brand new to CS and playing on my main was difficult when I have decent prem/ comp/ wingman rank, he had no chance to learn at a new level. I already struggle myself in 15k+ games (since 2nd season it refused to rank me lower than 18k) so wanted to start from scratch and work my way back up. I am not myself a great player so didn't feel too unfair to just play some chill games with him as he figured it out and learnt the game. Well It has been an unenjoyable experience for us both and I hate to think this is how any new player finds CS2. Pretty much every game has had 1-3 blatant cheaters with fresh level 1 accounts, crazy K/D stats on their accs, shooting like globals but playing like silvers (that or they are in fact global smurfs). Game sense out of this world (aka walls). I have had to report more players in the span of 2 months than the 3+ years I have played this game. And only one player who shot me through a wall with no sound q/ not a usual prefire bangable spot got banned. I have never been one to say 'they are cheating,' but now every game it is my go to. I feel so bad that this has been my bfs experience of CS and mine from a new players perspective. I thought I would have to downplay my skill for new/low rated players, but turns out I am the one struggling most games, getting headshot by running deagle and AK players- who apparently don't need to counter strafe or worry about recoil, shot through walls and smokes. These players hold the tightest angles, no jiggle peaking. literally holding the wall until you peak and don't miss a single shot... anyway you get the picture. This game has been a cheaters paradise for too long (not so bad if you have an established acc on prem but even then we all know 25k+ is majority of cheaters). There is no excuse, the community has loved this game for too long to not have a working anti-cheat. You are encouraging no new players to play CS. Pls fix the game and add an anti-cheat."
192177057,1743978144,True,"full of cheaters,but still the best shooter"
192171306,1743972318,True,tbh i dont get cheaters in my lobbys so everything good and very little bad stuff to say about this game
192169764,1743971041,True,"Counter-Strike 2 isn’t just a game — it’s a lifestyle. One moment you feel like John Wick, next moment you get one-tapped by someone jumping around with a P90 named 'Spray & Pray'. I’ve developed trust issues from fake bomb plants, PTSD from flashbangs, and a sixth sense for when someone’s camping in a corner. My reflexes are sharp, my aim is questionable, and my decision-making depends entirely on how loud the bomb beeps. But hey — as long as I get MVP once every 20 games, I consider myself a pro   Played CS2 to relax tho. Now my mouse is broken, my desk has a fist mark, and I'm arguing with a 12-year-old from Russia. Also new CS2 physics are cool — finally my team has an excuse for missing every shot.  11/10 game - I would recommend!"
192169592,1743970919,True,"i get shit talked alot for not being good, reminds me of COD black Ops 2 lobbies, good game"
192169420,1743970780,False,"Game just doesnt run well anymore, at least compared to CSGO. The only real positive of moving to CS2 is the volumetric smoke, but other than that CS2 is really not an improvement."
192169234,1743970622,True,"Rating: 8.5/10  Counter-Strike 2 brings a much-needed visual and engine upgrade to the classic shooter, now running on the Source 2 engine. The graphics are cleaner, smoke grenades are more dynamic, and the UI feels modern and polished.  Gameplay remains true to CS:GO, with tight gunplay and strategic depth. Some new features like sub-tick servers aim to improve performance, but the community is still split on their effectiveness.  The launch had a few hiccups—missing features, bugs, and mixed reactions from competitive players—but Valve is actively improving the game.  Overall, CS2 is a solid update that respects the legacy of CS:GO while pushing it into a new era."
192168289,1743969855,False,fuck this shit
192163557,1743965989,True,.
192161844,1743964658,False,Please Valve. for the love of all that is good and holy... PLEASE do something about the bots in arms race and deathmatch.
192161239,1743964187,True,"Even though I miss the old version of the game, this upgraded graphics and content is so nice that I have nothing to say anymore."
192158159,1743961743,True,best game if u like to gamble the shoting is like gambiling somethimes will going to hit but mostly u wont
192157514,1743961259,True,If you like to get killed by cheaters and bugs every game you should play
192156166,1743960277,False,"shit game, didn't deserve to transform cs:go->cs2 when they have the biggest problem with cheating through all the possible games. valve doesn't give a shit to fix it as it would cost them, vac live is fucking myth, had only two instances of it through my 50 games with cheaters. unplayable and those cheaters will never get the punishment what they deserve."
192155138,1743959476,False,"It's tragic that this trash replaced CS:GO. The game-play isn't as smooth; horrible UI changes were made--I miss the buy wheel. There's only one ""agent"" skin each for the Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists. There are more often bots playing than actual players."
192154936,1743959329,False,"this game is so infested with cheaters, and even after weeks of them cheating and being reported Valve DOES NOTHING against it. How come I have a sh*t trustfactor when I've been playing legit for years and get q-d up with cheaters?!?!? Can't get to 15k cuz 2/4 matches are blatant cheaters for me."
192153116,1743958044,True,"I swear if there was no cheating left in the game, it would be number one among the best games in the world, but they don't bother with the security of the game."
192151374,1743956785,False,Its just disappointing how little Valve is doing for the community and the game. Especially after all the promises when CS2 came out.
192151246,1743956683,False,"worst game ever, full of cheaters, steam valve anti cheat is a joke, shit game"
192151161,1743956627,False,valve fix your fucking game. I have at least 5 hours of replays with me hitting my enemy but the damage is gone
192150158,1743955900,False,"consider this a mixed review, this is by far the best arcade fps, BUT, the cheating problem is still horrible. its basically just the bot epidemic in tf2, although somewhat less in the current state of this game. valve, please stop making limited edition skins on a gun no one will ever use, just fix your anti cheat"
192144186,1743951636,False,-rep game veri bad make me ragequitttt and lose in only hacker matches
192141247,1743949471,True,"My experience so far with Counter-Strike 2.  Lots of australians are throwing competitive matches with a group, countless of cheaters from china are cheating in the prime competitive matchmaking, the only thing fun is getting nice loot from the new CS2 passes, just like MvM from Team Fortress 2, i am making a LOT of money.  This game is a nice investment."

192137467,1743946550,False,The game is a direct propaganda of unpunished cheating. This is not the level of a global company. Valve is a small indie company.

192127141,1743937808,True,good game best for free but cheaters is so shit gges pelase valve buy better anty cheat thanks bye
192126916,1743937593,False,"First of all, don’t pay attention to the playtime shown here, because I’ve been playing the game since it was first released. One of the most frustrating things about the game is the constant presence of cheaters, and unfortunately, Valve hasn’t found a solution to this issue. No matter what league you play in—whether it’s Silver, Nova, or even Global Elite—you’re bound to come across someone using cheats. If you take a look at the features of these cheats, you’d be shocked, so it’s something you really need to watch out for while playing."
192125069,1743935810,False,"Have seen full lobbies of spin-botting cheaters, yet when someone I was in a party with a ""suspicious"" player, I get a cooldown for it. Horrible moderation and anit-cheat."

192119164,1743929858,True,very gud game surfing is fun and nuke b bomb site smoke
192104959,1743913012,True,CS:GO was arguably better but this is a decent game for those who enjoy the modern CS experience. Though if you're playing on EU servers you may have to brush up on your Russian.
192098759,1743905939,True,Bring back bunny hopping and get a better anti cheat still a good game tho lol
192094671,1743901127,True,I am genuinely convinced that some people who use voice chat in this game are mental asylum escapees.
192094373,1743900764,True,"Es lo mejor que me ha pasado, aprendí insultos en inglés, subí 90 kilos, soy un completo fracasado, pero hey! mejoré mi aim"
192091716,1743897789,True,"As a guy who has 1000+ hours on siege, this just feels like a simpler, faster paced version of that. Still, I enjoy this game for its simplicity yet difficult mastery. Good tactical 5v5 to just hop into and have a good time, (or bad depending on the enemy team). Not to mention the common russian teamate that will begin screaming racial slurs down the mic to one of you guys because you messed up a grenade or something that leads to a massive arguement. Those guys are funny and make the experience better. This game also has alot of history, another cool thing about CS."
192090622,1743896536,True,"Very good game, i enjoy cussing out russians.  Fully recomend game!!!"

192082851,1743888768,True,"Game is amazing, needs more easter eggs / secrets though, love the game VALVe!"
192080795,1743886919,False,Was my favorite game  Now community is non-existent and cheaters are everywere.
192080773,1743886898,True,"Depending on what you expect from a game like CS, you either get greatly disappointed [b] or [/b] have a lot of fun. Can't speak to competetive too much, casual playing around [i] can [/i] be loads of fun, if you [b] DO NOT [/b] take it seriously. Weapon-specs seem to be quite on point, as well as the rest of the physics in-game.     Greatest challenge -especially for beginners- might be not getting kicked out every three rounds for playing too passive."
192077990,1743884806,False,"Way too many cheaters, its laughably difficult to get banned even with obvious cheats, at most they get a suspension never a full ban, its almost like a badly written joke."
192063496,1743873847,True,"A wonderful game to discover deep emotions like love, hate, anger and even lust. A wide spectrum of different characters you can meet during matchmaking, who can unlock long-held secrets of intimacy with your parents  and talk about your distinctive character traits.  It takes more than just playing, it takes the most valuable hours of your life and make you enjoy and hate it."
192062846,1743873375,True,"CS2 Review (a.k.a. The Game That Breaks You and Builds You Again)  CS2 is awesome... If you're into sweaty, competitive FPS games that demand your soul.  At first? You’ll suck. The aiming feels weird, counter-strafing makes no sense, and utilities? Yeah, good luck figuring those out.  But give it time. Like... 100 hours. Then suddenly it clicks. And it’s actually fun. Like, “yell at your screen and high-five your mouse” fun.  The community though? Oh boy. It’s a mix of legends, gremlins, and people who probably haven’t touched grass in months. Toxic? Sometimes. Funny? Occasionally. Mentally draining? Yes.  Also—cheaters. They exist. And Valve? Well... they’re kinda just watching it all happen. Maybe sipping coffee. Who knows.  Still, if you love a good challenge, some rage, and the occasional god-tier clutch... CS2 delivers.  Just... bring snacks. And patience."
192061330,1743872294,False,Its a piece of shit game that constantly crashesh full of cheaters and 0 consequesnces for griefers and cheaters
192060574,1743871735,False,"I used to think GabeN was the greatest person ever, until I played cs2. Knowing that Gabe Newell made the choice to replace CSGO with this sickens me. Full of cheaters, removal of basically everything that made CSGO fun, and more gambling is just what I hate about cs2."
192056651,1743868986,False,"Until Valve does something with cheaters, this garbage only gonna take your life away hour by hour. You have about 10-15% chance to play a game that you actually can enjoy any time you solo queue on official servers. That one game restores some hope, not all is lost! There are decent humans playing this game and having fun! Then the next 9 games are full with cheaters, disappointment, some russian or turkish dude screaming, teammates lacking brains, fps issues every time there are 2 smokes and 1 molotov thrown in middle, disappointment, wondering why are you doing this with yourself, disappointment and disappointment.   Since thisa is a negative review, it will probably get removed by Valve. If you don't have the game installed, don't install it, if you have it please uninstall. I should do that too."
192055234,1743867937,True,"From CSGO to CS2,     This game has been like an abusive girlfriend, you always come back even though you shouldn't. You know its nice with the initial love-bombing of nostalgia. The community is even worse often resorting to cynical highly-toxic short engaged conversations. You then have to somehow break through their hardened exterior shell which is like a game in itself. I'm telling you, it would take years of therapy to get groundbreaking progress with some of these members of the community. Very Unstable, they do however have PTSD from cheaters not properly held accountable, and terrible drop rates on the cases. Cases have been the issue of lawsuits for valve. Even over all of this i know after i uninstall, i will be back a week later, a month later, maybe even a half a year, hell maybe even several years. 0/10 do not recommend see you on the comp field boys."
192051874,1743865460,True,"Counter Strike is a team game for people who like self-harm. This game is like a drug, you know that after turning it on you will feel like you want to slit your wrists, but you still turn it on just like with drugs.   The goal of the game is to cooperate with individuals who have had a lobotomy and on top of that, each of them has the ego of the director of the globe. During the game, you will often have the urge to whip someone with an electric cable, but you will quickly get used to it. At the beginning of the game, you spawn with 4 other people, two of whom don't have a microphone and you wish the other two didn't have one. Most of them do not even speak English and they shout various spells at the others.   The basic tactic in this game is to die first and curse at the others. If you are lucky enough and happen to win a game, do not forget to write ""gg ez noobs"" in the chat.  Feel free to click the ""play"" button, which actually means ""give me 4 mentally challenged individuals on my team"" to find out how many people are actually sleeping with your mother."

This game is now infested with cheaters, bots, and bullies. Valve can't stop bullying, but they also seem to be endorsing cheating by not fixing this issue. I have heard talk about a couple new counter strike games, but I am not sure if it is true. Either way, I won't be purchasing any sort of video game from Valve in the future, especially if they can't and won't fix this one. I am a ""free to play"" type of player, but this was an absolute waste of $15. Google any CS2 cheating videos and you will see the real gameplay.

It's not you; it's the game. But hey, apparently another update looms in the near future - perhaps now they'll finally add another community-made map, maybe now they'll add cache? But no, just another collection in the Armory, and further discounts for the latest sticker capsule disappointment. Man, I miss the creativity and ingenuity of CS:GO, now we're left with a greedy money-grab that Valve have all but abandoned. Another one bites the dust. Yet somehow, it's still addictive. This game brings me nothing but rage and disappointment if I try, anguished laughter and annoyed teammates when I don't. Don't play this until some love is brought back to the game, not more skins. How about a new weapon? Gamemode? Anything but content that earns Valve money? Wishful thinking."

Overall unless you don't mind having skins, dealing with hackers, some toxic parts of the community and needing to play daily to be at the same level of others, I would not recommend"

191831822,1743629324,True,"i really do want this game to live up to what CS:GO was, but in its current state it fails to meet the minimum requirements to be considered either on par or above GO and as a sequel its pretty disappointing atm.  There are a few issues with the game, however the main ones for me are the poor anti-cheat, poor Linux support, poor performance, and sub-tick.  Although the anti-cheat issues mostly concern higher elo lobbies, its still more common than I would like to see blatant cheaters in game. I bought premier simply to play the game without cheaters, but even then Valve misses the mark and I get cheaters in my games.  The Linux issues include the inability to play the game correctly under the Wayland backend. Although you can play via XWayland, this exhibits a whole host of issues, including poor frame pacing, decreased fps, increased latency, and little to no compatibility with stretched resolutions. There have been open conversations with Valve for for months about this issue however there has been no change in any updates to the game, it seems to, at this moment in time, get worse by the update.  The Vulkan backend which is used on the Linux native version of the game is also quite shoddy. It exhibits a lot of issues as well which would be mitigated if Valve allowed Linux users to play the game using DXVK like we could on GO (or Valve could actually fix the Vulkan issues, who knows). I have no idea how the Vulkan backend performs on Windows, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't very good there either.  The performance issues with the game currently are also pretty annoying. When playing at the exact same locked fps as CS:GO, I would expect the game to feel the exact same however it just is not the case. Whilst the fps being reported seems stable, the frametimes are all over the place - with the game feeling extrememly jittery and overall unsmooth. However, when reverting back to GO or Source, and playing at the same fps is a completely different experience; buttery smooth gameplay all around. Sub-tick is also just overall trash. The fact that Valve also disallowed FACEIT to use 128 tick is pretty funny too, but thats another story.  Overall, I would still recommend the game. It's Counter-Strike. One of the pinnacles of gaming. The game still works, and while sure, it may not have the same performance that GO had, its probably one of the best looking games that has come out in the past few years. In the age of required ray tracing, upscaling, poor anti-aliasing methods like TAA, among other issues, it actually isn't so bad in perspective."

Moving to source 2 was good decision. Or is it?  Obviously in every game there are cheaters. But this case is such a big thing, that it makes me go crazy.  In this game, there's no miracle, no fucking way anyone in Valve is trying to deal with the problem of cheaters. Every game, ESPECIALLY on higher ranks there are always blatant wallhack players, telling that they're just good and you are a silver with no brain. Ohhh, indeed, we lost the [b]Overwatch[/b] system for all players(I mean, there might be some wrong cases but still).

The CS community is massive, and one of the things that i like the most about it is how easy it is to find help, even for the most niche problems. Whether you're troubleshooting settings, looking for tips to improve, or just trying to understand the whats good and whats not, there’s always something out there willing to help.    Another thing I love is the large market for skins, buying, selling, and trading really provides a feeling of security to the game. If you end up quitting CS, you can just sell your skins for real cash on third party platforms, and it is also very enjoyable to see your inventory grow over time (speaking from experience on val)    That being said, just because this game is free doesn’t mean it won’t cost you your sanity :steamhappy:"

This game needs vac improvments,more maps,but really if gameplay was same and fun from csgo,I don't see problem and see no reasson for hate on vlave.If you really want to play old maps that aren't in cs2 then play community servers.I think in future there will be more likeable updates because valve for 3 years had to push cs2,after that they had to release patch updates and all that,untill that future comes when valve fixes cs2 enjoy the updates they make and the game to the fullest you can."
191726103,1743516615,False,It just straight up isn't fun anymore. Valve removed everything that was good about CSGO and made the game just miserable to play. I wouldn't be surprised if the game was dead before the end of the year. Do better valve

191685134,1743464016,True,"What can I say.....CS2 really did improve on csgo. ✅Way better anti-cheat.Valve really did improve on the VAC. There's no way in shape of form you can meet any kind of cheaters. (example:wallhackers,aimbot etc) ✅Servers are better.Game servers now runs on 128-tick. You cant encounter any single lag in the game.No in-game delay Shoots always registers no matter what. ✅ Physics are just next gen shi.There was totally no meme about the player models doing Michael Jackson type moves. (Source 2 is genuinely an improvement imo cant say anything about that all tho physics appearently has changed a bit) ✅ Updates:Valve supports this game tons.There is so many updates that players just cant get enough of it! (So many new maps like:  ____________________                               or source 2 upgraded maps like:  _________________                                 ) ✅ Totally didnt remove any content from csgo.Definitely didnt remove any (example:maps gamemodes)  Overrall just way better than csgo  -10/0      Would recommend✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅"

191666250,1743445005,True,"Picked up CS very late, but has quickly became my favorite game. Just wish CS2 felt more like CSGO. The subtick system is atrocious and should be replaced with 64 tick servers at a minimum. This is because the hit registration, sprays, and bhops are nowhere near as good in CSGO. If your ping is above 50 the subtick system is not kind to you.  I'll continue to play but please remove subtick."

You report people just to see them still playing a month later, so nothing is being done. Last 3 games was basically full teams of hackers. And to top it off, you cant q premier with a five stack with your friends, so well done on that one!! Done with this piece of trash game."

There isn't a fair ban system like they let actual hackers slide and people with actual skill no?  I really don't recommend this to people because when you get good at it you just simply get banned by vac and after hate this game and never play it again even tho if your talented or not.w
191660109,1743439661,True,"Counter Strike 2.0 – A Killer Experience, But Cheaters Ruin the Fun 🖤💀  Counter Strike 2.0 is straight up fire 🔥. The graphics hit hard, the gameplay is sharp, and every corner of the map feels like it's designed to make your heart race. It’s intense, it’s brutal, and it’s everything you want in a tactical shooter. 🖤💣  The weapons feel weighty, the sound is crisp, and the thrill of sneaking through the shadows or busting down doors with your squad is unmatched. 👁️💥 Whether it’s an insane headshot or a perfect bomb plant, there’s nothing like it. And the gunplay? You can feel the power in every shot. ⚡️💀  But let’s get real for a second. There’s a plague lurking in these matches. Cheaters. 🖤🤬 You know the type – the ones with wallhacks, aimbots, and probably some dark magic up their sleeve. 😤 They make every match feel like you're fighting ghosts. They see through walls, hit perfect shots from across the map, and it’s like they’re playing a completely different game. 🖤👽  It’s soul-crushing. Like, you’re grinding, trying to be tactical, dodging bullets, and then BOOM – headshot from nowhere. How is that even possible? Like, do these cheaters have a crystal ball or something? 🖤🔮  Valve, listen up – the game’s amazing when it works, but you need to bring down the hammer on these hackers. ⚡️🖤 We all want fair matches. We all want to dive into that dark world of tactical warfare without being turned into a punching bag by some cheater hiding in the shadows. 👿  So, while the game is absolutely fire, I’m just here hoping for a clean battlefield where we can fight fair and square. No more cheaters. No more wallhackers. Just pure, adrenaline-fueled chaos. 🖤🔥  Let’s get it together, Counter Strike. We’re ready for that next level. ⚔️💀"
191659948,1743439511,True,its pretty good game but the problem is with cheaters
191652895,1743433382,False,totally trash game along with the developer who created valve anti cheat
191651221,1743431908,True,"Counter-Strike 2 is an upgrade to the classic FPS, featuring improved graphics, better performance, and a revamped smoke grenade system. It keeps the core gameplay intact while introducing new strategic elements. However, it still lacks some features from CS:GO and has issues with hit registration and balancing, still need an improvement on anti-cheat system. CS2 is free , making it worth trying, but it feels more like an evolution than a revolution. With ongoing updates, it has the potential to be just as beloved as its predecessor."
191649868,1743430743,True,ever since starting this game my hair has went grey and started falling out because my teammates decide to be rubbing their meat while in a match instead of aiming properly. 5 stars.

191635877,1743415489,True,its good game but never play competitive with randoms
191634991,1743414156,False,"- Bots are now a big problem. Every second casual or death match game I now try to load into either has a full stack of bots on both sides (resulting in me getting kicked immediately) or bots will try flood the servers when they empty out. How is this fun not being able to consistently get a game with actual people in it?   - The Vac system is a joke. I've encountered a fair amount of cheaters so far in competitive games - a lot of wallers mostly - and nothing seems to happen to them.  No amount of reporting seems to do a thing. I ended up on a team with one guy who walled the entire time, told us that someone else on the other team was walling as well, then said hes been doing it for 9 months without consequence. Is it fun to end up in games where your'e almost guaranteed an unfair disadvantage?  But i'm so glad that we now have an armoury pass, so I can pay for the privilege to maybe get a terrible virtual skin, that as per the Steam Subscriber Agreement - you don't actually legally own.  This game has been around in one form or another for over 20 years now. How about you focus on making sure its not being farmed by the botters and cheaters before milking."

191438148,1743221429,True,"One of the greatest tactical shooters...  Cons. A lot of cheaters in ranked modes (Seems like they are trying to fix it with they anti-cheat but now some normal players are getting unjustified cooldowns. It may be one of the only things that makes me want to just leave the game)  Pros. 1. Simple (easy to understand and get the hang of for new players) 2. Stunning Visuals (realistic textures and great particle effects) 3. Optimized for Competitive Play (great matchmaking that keeps players of all levels entertained) 4. Advanced Movement and Gunplay (the movement mechanics and gunplay feel incredibly fluid and satisfying) 5. Wonderful Matchmaking System (the matchmaking system is quick and effective, making it easy for players to find matches that suit their skill level) 6. Community Content Integration (the game fully supports community-created content, including custom maps, skins, and mods) (I always like discovering new aim training and hide-and-seek maps) 7.Satisfying Kill Animations (I personally really like the killing animations. They're simple but satisfying to see the cards appear in the lower center of your screen)"
191429213,1743211619,False,"One of the worst maintained games I've ever played. If you want cheaters and throwers in 9/10 games you play, this is the game for you. Nothing gets done. They came out with a CS2 before they fixed the gigantic issue of cheaters in there game. You can talk to the cheaters in game who admit they are cheating, and they will tell you they have been cheating for years without a ban. If they do receive a ban it is extremely easy to make or buy a new account and continue cheating. Even if you are winning 10-1 don't worry your teammate will decide he doesn't like you anymore, team kill you, and throw the rest of the game. Also if a teammate does not join the game don't worry, the game will start and you will play a 4v5. Keep in mind nothing will be done to the players cheating or throwing whether that be in premier, competitive, or even deathmatch. And I believe it will stay that way for even more years to come. Good luck."

191361880,1743147481,True,i liked the graphics
191360132,1743144854,True,"I've played CS:GO/CS2 for around 8 years now and never left a review for some reason but here it is now. The new engine update from Source > Source 2 changed the performance and visual quality for the better, however the movement and other important things changed which took getting used to. The new Vulkan implementation is also a great addition to the native linux version which improves performance instead of using DXVK.  One crucial thing that was removed was Cache, everyone loved cache and valve just nuked it from CS2 so we can no longer enjoy it on official matchmaking servers. I also miss cobblestone and would love to have it back, please add it back Gabe I beg you.  The VAC issue has always been here with lots of cheaters ruining games, especially in premier mode. I do like that VAC isn't in the kernel being invasive but at the same time it isn't super effective either.  Most players lost the ability to take part in overwatch which was crucial to getting cheaters banned quickly with players reviewing match replays and selecting an option to explain what was happening, if the player was using wallhack, aimbot or something simple such as griefing in matches the reviewing players could select that option to inform valve of their findings. Sure a few people got false banned but it helped a lot with getting a lot of cheaters banned fast too.  More often in my leetify I see players getting banned more often which is a good sign but it still isn't happening fast enough, we cannot enjoy the game with the amount of cheaters running around and most of them are ""legit cheating"" which means mostly using ESP (Wallhack) and trying to keep as legit looking as possible. Back in CS:GO times a lot of people liked to ragehack so it was easier to spot them.  I will still recommend the game of course because I enjoy it but this review is something to look at and consider for sure. Giving the players control again (Overwatch) is a step in the right direction, we need it back."

191335886,1743115425,False,"Perspective from a guy who is not that good at the game:  Good things: -Nice graphics and physics. Game gets new mechanics like breaking smokes with nades. -Feels a bit more noob friendly run and gun doesnt feel that punishing. I feel like I can finally shoot (sometimes lol) -Nice battlepass idea for 40 stars you can get 20 guns. not bad.  Bad things:  - Map rotation in premier is stiff and there is high risk to play same map whole day due to popularity - Bad optimised - Battlepass is not updating often - my friends got weird bugs where they shoot the enemy and looks like he falls dead and then he magically revives. - Matchmaking is a disaster.   Premier: I did not pay for it I have it because i bought csgo when it was not a free version. Game sets high expectations for this gamemode. A premium experience and no cheaters and yadda yadda. I played like 100 games of this matchmaking with main focus on improving and learning the game. My expectation for this was to have balanced matchmaking and teammates that want to play and coordinate. However I got: - cheaters -> did not encounter a lot but i encounter some which are literally blatant not even hiding it - 4k premier elo with 3k hours dropping 30 bombs - faceit players who are low rank in premier and come and play to get the weekly box but they are toxic towards other. I quote: ""You are too old for this game go play something else"" - griefers  - 5 stack enemy team vs 5 soloq ( i won games where we were all soloq but other games are literally stomps and not a point playing the other guys have a full strat book)  Note: I don't have anything with smurfs its their work to be good at the game but it is just frustrating to have them most of the games.   normal competitive:  a way to chill and i see more new players in this section. same things happen. smurfs described  above play against them cuz he has silver rank on that map.   Some games are fair and balanced which is actually the experience i like. But most of games are not like this.  I do not recommend it as a main competitive game."

191311401,1743093726,True,"[b]My Review of Counter-Strike 2  I’ve played almost 1000 hours of CS on another account, so this review is based on my personal experience.[/b]  [h2]Pros: The graphics are noticeably better — more polished and detailed compared to CS:GO. The movement feels more dynamic and interesting. It’s still a great game with tons of workshop maps, so even if you’re not playing competitively, you can have fun with friends.  Cons: To play comfortably, you really need a good PC and a decent monitor. The experience depends a lot on external factors like ping, hardware, and peripherals. The damage system and shooting mechanics feel inconsistent and not very satisfying.  About the community: I know player behavior varies, but I’d recommend Valve to introduce a system that monitors player behavior more effectively. Many players are toxic, and some act overly aggressive because they take the game too seriously, like wannabe e-sports pros. And one of the biggest issues is still cheaters — it ruins the experience for many.[/h2]  [b]Also, I really hope Valve introduces official 128-tick servers. Playing on 64-tick servers often feels like I’m running the game at 60 FPS, even when I actually have 300.[/b]  [h2]My rating: 74/100[/h2]"

Sure, it’s competitive and fast-paced, but that’s part of what makes it exciting. The game rewards strategy, teamwork, and quick thinking. Even though I’m still learning the maps and getting used to the mechanics, the experience has been super engaging.  The updated graphics, smoother gameplay, and cleaner UI make it really enjoyable. There’s a learning curve, no doubt, but every round teaches you something new. And the community? Intense, but you’ll find helpful players tooespecially in casual or deathmatch modes. Whether I win or lose, each match feels like progress. If you're new and curious, don't be intimidated. CS2 is definitely beginner-friendly if you're willing to learn—and totally worth it."

If you focus too much on ranking up, you'll just drive yourself crazy.  There are a lot of cheaters in the game, especially if you don't have Prime status—or even if you do, but you're a high rank.  Long story short: just try to play for fun rather than focusing too much on competing."

The new player experience is horrible and the community is toxic enough for most that its honestly not worth it.

191098033,1742845956,True,"Every game mode in a nutshell: -Arms race: You are always stuck at THAT weapon, but somehow some guy manages to speedrun trough all them.(Is he jack of all trades or smth?) -Deathmatch: Sometimes swarming with hackers, sometimes swarming with the best player I could have seen.(Most of the time just chaos) -Casual: Why would you even play this? High chance of hackers, map full of players, you dont understand anything but somehow manage to die fast enough to get bored. -Competitive: Maybe hackers, ZERO coordonation between teammates, exelent enemies-horrible allies. You say to go B, they nonchalantly go to the OPPOSITE direction. And of course the god damit bomb carrier is there. They are blind and have no headphones, they see the enemy passing by and they switch to knife. The enemies makes footsteps but this incapacitated mf cant hear them. Somehow they manage to make the worst gameplay when is actually needed, but sometimes they make the most wonderfull game. They shoot you for no reason and then they stare at you like some bot or smth. Gets in front of you and body block you.  -Wingman: 50% chance for a good teammate, 50% for the most horrrible creature that is there just to throw your match, I swear.  10/10 expierience i would kill my teammate again for no reason again"

191068694,1742820590,True,"So, Counter-Strike 2—the long-awaited sequel to the legendary Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—is finally here, and man, it’s something. If you're a fan of the series, you'll definitely feel at home, but there’s enough new stuff to keep things fresh and exciting.  First off, let’s talk about the graphics. The game is now running on Source 2 engine, and it shows. The visuals are sharper, the lighting is on point, and the environments feel more alive. It's not just about eye candy though—everything from weapon models to the maps looks more polished. Even the character models are better, with more detailed textures and smoother animations.  But don’t worry, it’s still Counter-Strike at its core. The feel of the game is very familiar—fast-paced, tense, and full of those ""one shot, one kill"" moments that make your heart race. If you’ve been playing CS:GO for years, it won’t take long to adjust to CS2’s mechanics. However, there are tweaks that make the gameplay feel smoother overall. The movement feels a bit more fluid, and the shooting mechanics are crisper—probably thanks to all the tech improvements under the hood.  The sound design is also top-notch, and if you're into that ""feel the game"" experience, the improved sound effects really help with immersion. The gunfire, footsteps, and ambient sounds all come together to create a tense atmosphere, especially during those clutch moments when every move counts.  One of the things that stands out to me is the matchmaking and anti-cheat improvements. Valve has clearly worked hard on making the game more accessible while keeping the competitive integrity intact. The Danger Zone mode is still around (if you’re into that), but they’ve made sure the classic modes like Competitive and Wingman stay front and center.  As for the community, it’s the same as always—competitive, passionate, and full of people who take this game way too seriously. The map pool is updated, with some fan-favorite maps returning, and there’s a sense of nostalgia mixed with the new. The gameplay hasn’t lost its edge; if anything, the updates have sharpened it.  Overall, CS2 feels like a natural evolution of CS:GO. It takes the things we loved and fine-tunes them with modern tech. It's fresh, it's familiar, and it’s just as addictive as ever. If you’re a Counter-Strike veteran, you'll find plenty to enjoy here. And if you’re new to the series, it’s a great entry point. Either way, CS2 delivers the tactical shooting experience we all know and love, just with a bit of a facelift."
191065935,1742817393,True,The game is still enjoyable but I still get some cheaters ingame (Prime User Here)    1 problem though is that I get semi VAC ban or something in between that just kick me out of the game because maybe that it thinks I am cheating but I am not at all. The cheat detection needs some fixing to be honest so that the players that aren't cheating don't actually get semi ban like me.

I have been falsely banned despite never engaging in any cheating or rule-breaking behavior. This is completely unfair, and I expect a proper review of my case.  I have invested time and money into this game, and to be wrongly banned without any explanation or chance to appeal is unacceptable. I demand that my case be seriously reviewed and that I receive a clear reason for this unjust punishment.  This ban is a mistake, and I am not going to accept being falsely labeled as a cheater. Please escalate this issue and take another look at my account.  Looking forward to a real resolution.  Best, Mico"

Fast forward to CS:GO, and that same excitement is still there. The mechanics are tight, the strategy deep, and the community, while tough - keeps me coming back.  What I love most is how CS:GO has grown with me. The maps, the sounds, and even the familiar ""terrorists win"" call take me back to simpler times. It's not just about the game itself but the memories and friendships that have come with it. Even after all these years, CS:GO remains a constant, a piece of my past and present.

Players are required to engage in thorough analysis, learning how to approach each situation strategically while leveraging the unique features of various environments.    Furthermore, mastering recoil control on every weapon is a critical aspect of achieving proficiency within the game. It takes considerable dedication and practice to develop a fine-tuned understanding of how to manage the recoil patterns across a wide array of firearms. This skill is essential for players striving to reach the highest levels of performance, as it directly impacts accuracy, timing, and overall effectiveness in combat.    The learning curve in this game is notably steep, and the journey to becoming a skilled player is both challenging and rewarding. As one progresses through the stages of development, the game continuously tests the player's adaptability, decision-making abilities, and overall tactical prowess. Success is not merely a product of reaction speed, but also of one's capacity to think critically, predict opponents' actions, and adapt to ever-changing situations in the game.    Additionally, this game provides a unique opportunity to familiarize oneself with the Russian language. Through in-game interactions, communication with teammates, and exposure to various elements of the game's environment, players can gain valuable exposure to Russian vocabulary, phrases, and cultural nuances. For individuals seeking to improve their proficiency in Russian, this game offers an engaging and enjoyable way to enhance language skills in a real-world context, all while providing the thrill of intense, competitive gameplay.    In conclusion, this game is an excellent choice for those who are not only passionate about skill-based, tactical gameplay but also interested in language acquisition. Its blend of strategic depth, skill mastery, and the opportunity to learn Russian makes it a multifaceted and highly enriching experience."

193401916,1745406663,True,"Review: Counter-Strike 2 – A Refined Evolution of a Classic  Counter-Strike 2 marks a new era for one of the most iconic first-person shooter franchises in gaming history. Building upon the rock-solid foundation of CS:GO, CS2 elevates the experience with the power of the Source 2 engine, bringing modern visuals, improved performance, and a suite of new features that enhance both casual and competitive play.  Visual Overhaul The first thing you notice in CS2 is the dramatic visual upgrade. Maps like Dust II and Mirage have been reimagined with more realistic lighting, cleaner textures, and improved geometry—while still retaining the iconic layouts players know and love. Smoke grenades now interact dynamically with the environment, bullets, and light, creating new tactical layers that feel fresh without breaking the core gameplay loop.  Gameplay That Respects Its Roots The gameplay remains as sharp and skill-based as ever. CS2 doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel—it refines it. Movement feels smoother, hit registration is more consistent, and the netcode improvements are a blessing for competitive matches. For longtime fans, it's like slipping back into your favorite pair of sneakers—just more comfortable and better looking.  Matchmaking & Community Tools Valve has taken strides to modernize matchmaking and community integration. Competitive players will appreciate the upgraded ranking system and cleaner UI, while newcomers will find onboarding slightly more accessible than in previous iterations. Workshop support and community servers continue to thrive, giving CS2 the same grassroots energy that helped CS:GO flourish.  Final Thoughts CS2 is a masterclass in how to evolve a legendary title without losing what made it great. It’s faster, prettier, and more polished—but still offers the same adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes gameplay that has captivated players for over two decades. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a curious newcomer, Counter-Strike 2 is well worth your time.  Rating: 9.5/10 A beautiful blend of nostalgia and innovation—Counter-Strike has never felt better."
193390172,1745387435,True,"One serious issue - Please Address New player experience is awful, if you want to have success getting new players to stay longer than one game, please consider the following; Reduce XP CAP - I have over 120 hours and still cannot play Prem, I am forced to play against 3000 hour players who are still silver on comp due to only playing prem or faceit. Matchmaking - Matchmaking is being ruined due to the reason above, I will have a team mate losing their mind at their 20 hour team mate who cannot throw a flashbang without blinding their team, it is bad for both new players and veterans, carry over elo from prem to regular comp please.  The poor match making also has a flow on effect, lots of low hour players instantly calling cheats or wallhacks because a player with 1000 hours prefires the worlds most common angle to hold, to any sane player this is easy to do, to a new player, swinging angles, crosshair placement and prefires are just hacking.  Besides that the game is awesome, only reason i'm sticking around is because I love a game with few chances for ""randomness"" and pure repeatable skill, high skill ceiling where you do not feel like something was just unfair."
193389519,1745386384,False,Prime upgrade is not worth it because there are more wallhack cheat kiddies than without Prime.
193385129,1745379731,True,"Okay, I have over 300 hours in CS:GO. And somehow, despite all the blood, sweat, and keyboard rage I’ve poured into this game, I’m still here—writing a review about how much I absolutely despise it. But… I love it. I really do. CS:GO is like the toxic ex you can’t quit—every time you swear it off, it pulls you back in with a clutch play or a smooth headshot that makes you think, “Maybe I’m actually good at this.” Spoiler: I’m not. The community? Oh, it’s a beautiful dumpster fire. It's like walking into a room full of people who think they’re the next esports prodigy while you’re just over here trying to figure out how to properly throw a flashbang without blinding yourself. It’s a chaotic mess where everyone is a god, and I am the unfortunate 13-year-old with a voice crack trying to explain why I didn’t buy armor because I just had enough money for a deagle. “BUY A DEFUSER!” they yell, even though I was the one who defused the bomb last round, you ungrateful pixel warrior. The language in this game? Oh boy. It's like a master class in toxic masculinity and insecurity. I’ve never heard so many grown men act like their whole identity hinges on being the best at a 10-year-old game. It’s always the same—guys who are so insecure about their skill who’ve convinced themselves that yelling at random strangers online will somehow make them feel better about their lives. Somehow, I keep coming back. I guess I’m addicted to the pain. The matchmaking system? More like ""matchmaking mystery."" Every time I join a game, I’m greeted by a mix of 12-year-olds who think they’re in Call of Duty and people who are just aggressively shouting in their mics. ""I’m a pro"" says one guy with a 1-8 K/D. Alright, buddy, sure. You know what though? I love it. There’s something about CS:GO that keeps me coming back. Sure, I’ve had my heart broken by the game more times than I can count (many, many, many opened cases with nothing but blue skins of despair), but every time I hear the sweet sound of the bomb ticking down, or the satisfying clink of a headshot, I remember why I keep playing. Would I recommend this game to anyone? Well, yes, but only if you’re ready to experience frustration, confusion, and an unhealthy dependency on substances. CS:GO is like that abusive relationship that always promises it’ll get better, but deep down, we all know the truth: it won’t.  But hey, I’ll still be playing tomorrow.  1/10, but like, a 10/10 for masochism.  Also Valve, your anti-cheat system is like a fire extinguisher that only works when there’s no fire. It bans me for breathing too loudly, but hackers are out here flying around the map like it’s GTA. Maybe it's time for VAC to actually start working instead of just pretending it's on the job while hackers run wild."

193197886,1745165605,True,"""This game will make you want to eat a brick—raw.""  The anti-cheat is so bad it might as well be a fan cheering on the hackers. CS2 doesn’t just introduce you to competitive shooters—it welcomes you into the glamorous world of hardcore gambling addiction with skins shinier than your future.  And yet... you restart the game. Why? Because after 14 soul-crushing rounds of getting turned into digital Swiss cheese, you finally land one single, glorious kill. In that moment, you're not a bottom-fragger—you’re the chosen one.  Sure, the enemy team is doing synchronized Olympic 360s and headshotting you before your ping can say “hello,” but that one kill? That’s dopamine, baby. Injected straight into the veins.  10/10. Would cry again."

193027181,1744989744,True,"From the moment I stepped into the revamped world of Counter-Strike 2, I knew I was experiencing something truly special. This isn't just an update; it's a complete reimagining of the tactical shooter that has defined a genre for decades. Counter-Strike 2 takes everything that made its predecessor great and elevates it to an entirely new level of excellence.  The first thing that strikes you is the visual overhaul. The Source 2 engine breathes new life into iconic maps, rendering them in stunning detail. Every texture, every lighting effect, is meticulously crafted, creating an immersive and visually breathtaking experience. But this isn't just about aesthetics; the improved graphics enhance gameplay, providing greater clarity and depth to the environment.  But the true genius of Counter-Strike 2 lies in its gameplay. The core mechanics that define Counter-Strike – the precise gunplay, the strategic depth, the heart-pounding tension of each round – remain, but they've been refined to near perfection. The new subtick system ensures that every action, every movement, every shot registers with unparalleled accuracy, making every kill feel incredibly satisfying.  The updated smoke grenades are a game-changer, adding a new layer of strategic complexity. The way they interact with the environment, filling spaces dynamically, opens up a world of tactical possibilities. Whether you're using them to block vision, create cover, or execute a perfectly timed push, the new smokes add a dynamic and exciting element to every match.  Counter-Strike 2 also introduces a host of other improvements, from the streamlined interface to the enhanced audio design. The sound of gunfire, the footsteps of approaching enemies, the subtle environmental cues – all contribute to a heightened sense of realism and immersion.  But beyond the technical improvements, Counter-Strike 2 captures the essence of what makes this game so special: the community. The thrill of competition, the camaraderie of teamwork, the shared experience of victory and defeat – these are the things that make Counter-Strike more than just a game; it's a phenomenon. And Counter-Strike 2 embraces and celebrates that community, providing a platform for players to connect, compete, and create memories that will last a lifetime.  In conclusion, Counter-Strike 2 is a masterpiece. It's a testament to the enduring power of tactical shooters, a celebration of community, and a glimpse into the future of competitive gaming. It's not just one of the best games I've ever played; it's a game that has redefined what's possible."

At least in my opinion. I don't think too many things, but when I do I think smarts. My smarts tell me this is a bad idea and way too many cheaters will be able to run through this unscathed.

Ranking system is even worst, when I had 12k rating I played couple of games with 15-16k guys, in those few games they had bellow 10 kills (to be exact one of them had 2 kills in 12 rounds on ct side inferno with 15.600k rating). And of course I have 1 question for guys that are ""playing for fun"". Where is fun choosing map that you don't know how to play, for example: nuke, vertigo, ancient and anubis and having 3-6 kills in whole map? I would love to hear what is fun there. If you love to play those maps I don't have anything against that, just you can go in competitive mode and play there whatever map you want. Because if you for example don't know smokes on any of maps that I put above, you can't play that map. Because: player that knows smokes will go around map freely and kill you easily even if you are better at aiming than him with your 8,9,10,11,12k rating. BECAUSE: one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ molly or smoke can move you out of position and put you on the middle of the site where you are open for ENEMY. You need around 80 IQ to understand this, if you don't understand, ask yourself. Have fun ""gamers"". I just want to add it's even worst now."

I’ve got over 100 wins, and I’m still stuck at 3.2k it’s driving me fucking insane.  Back when the game launched, the ranking system was so much better. Ranks moved up and down more freely, and you actually felt like you were getting somewhere. Now, I’m just permanently stuck at 3k, and it’s exhausting.

Currently, players can accept a match by simply clicking the ""Accept"" button with the mouse. However, in Dota 2, you can accept a match by pressing the Enter key, which makes the process faster and more convenient. I believe that adding the same functionality to CS2 - allowing players to accept a match using the Enter key - would improve the user experience. This small change can improve accessibility and make it easier for many players to find partners. Thank you for considering this suggestion, and I appreciate all your work on CS2!

Nothing seem to change when it comes to anti cheat improvements/game mechanics to counter those cheaters. but one thing became clear for me, is that cs 2 going towards the way of a cash grab game where the majority of the content is skins and we left behind the whole purpose of counter strike. I'm sure many players feel more or less the same . I do hope for a change and want to believe the team is working behind the curtains to improve the anti cheat and game mechanics even better ! ."

On top of that you get kept hostage in these games with no way to surrender. Even if there is a 30/0 Cheater on the enemy team you still have to suffer through 10-15 minutes of this mockery of a game.     Cheating and griefing is actively supported in this game.

192787227,1744709980,False,"""Counter-Strike 2: Where Cheaters Carry and Bots Are Your Teammates""    ⭐️☆☆☆☆ (1/5 – ""Thanks, I hate it."")    If you've always dreamed of playing a ""Guess Which of These 10 Players Is Actually Human"" simulator, then CS2 is the perfect game for you! Valve apparently decided that a competitive shooter was too boring, so they added a ""Russian Roulette with Cheaters"" mode.    Pros:   - Free! (Because otherwise, no one would suffer through this.)   - Great training for your nervous system. Nothing toughens you up like losing a round to a guy named xX_Aimbot_God_Xx who wallbangs with 98% headshots.   - Bots on your team are like a side quest—""Escort the Potatoes Out of the Blast Zone""—except there’s no reward.    Cons:   - Anti-cheat? Never heard of it. VAC is about as effective as a cartoon cop who shows up after the fight is over.   - The game has turned into ""Who Can Buy Private Cheats First."" Lobbies feel like the dark web, but with more Russian screaming.   - ""Practice"" bots in Deathmatch only teach you one thing—how to quit the game fast and cry into your pillow.    Verdict: CS2 isn’t a sequel—it’s a social experiment: ""How many cheaters can a player endure before breaking?"" If you enjoy wasting your time and sanity, welcome aboard! For everyone else, I recommend playing literally anything else. Even Minesweeper. At least the bots there don’t camp the bomb site."

The cheaters and my teammates seem to be working in tandem,  But then I remember that it's just bad randoms.  ""Why push without cover?!""

191710906,1743500316,True,"The Steyr SSG 08 (German: Scharfschützengewehr 2008, English: Sniper Rifle 08) is an Austrian-made bolt-action sniper rifle. In-game, the SSG 08 is a cheap sniper rifle option available to both teams at $1700, fulfilling the same role as the Steyr Scout in previous games. It holds 10 rounds per magazine and has a very large reserve capacity at 90 rounds.  Being bolt-action, the SSG 08 has a very low rate of fire, though a little faster than the AWP. It also has a long reload time like the AWP. It has good bullet penetration power. Like the Scout, the weapon is lightweight for a sniper rifle, but players will not gain a speed bonus with SSG 08 out and will have a speed of 230 units per second.  As a sniper rifle, the weapon is equipped with a high power lens scope for long range engagement. When not scoped in, the rifle is inaccurate (though better than the AWP) and has no crosshair to assist aiming. The scope can be used with secondary fire, and pressing secondary fire again while scoped in zooms in the scope. Unlike other sniper rifles, the player's movement speed is not reduced while scoped in.  Firing the weapon causes the player to leave the scope temporarily to operate the bolt before automatically scoping in again. The player will leave the scope if they use secondary fire again at the higher zoom setting or switches weapons.  When zoomed in and not moving, the rifle has a near-perfect accuracy, able to hit anything as long as the crosshair of the scope is on target. Moving drastically reduces accuracy, and even more so with jumping. However, one notable aspect of the SSG 08 is that it is very accurate at the peak of a vertical jump. It is the only weapon in the entire Counter-Strike series to be able to perfectly retain its hipfire accuracy at the peak of a jump.  Like its predecessor, the SSG 08 will always deliver instant headshot kills, but is unable to achieve an instant bodyshot kill unlike the AWP. However, unlike the Scout, the SSG 08 can kill unarmored targets at full health with a shot to the gut. Due to the unusual location of the hitbox location however, this is a difficult task to achieve.  Overall, the SSG 08 is a serviceable sniper rifle option for the team sniper in early rounds and eco rounds, usually replaced by the AWP when the economy is favorable.  The SSG 08 is the one of the only weapon available in the Flying Scoutsman game mode along with the Knife.

192584162,1744469239,False,"Unfortunately, I can't agree with the hype surrounding Counter-Strike 2. As a long-time fan of CS:GO, I had high hopes, but CS2 feels like a step backwards in many places.  Technical problems: The game still suffers from serious bugs, lags and performance issues months after release. Many players report FPS drops and instability, even on high-end PCs. Netcode problems and poor hit registers mean that you can't hit the target reliably even with a good response time - which is absolutely crucial in a game like CS.  Gameplay & Movement: Compared to CS:GO, the movement feels spongier and less precise. Classics such as Counter Punishment no longer work properly, which has a negative impact on skill-based gameplay. Many veterans complain that the game “no longer feels like Counter-Strike”.  Missing features & content: Numerous features from CS:GO are simply missing: some game modes, maps or even functions in the menu have been removed without replacement or are incompletely integrated. Community servers and workshop support are also severely limited.  Matchmaking & Anti-Cheat: Matchmaking is still frustrating. Cheaters are still a major problem and the VAC system is just as ineffective as before. Fair games are often pure chance.  Conclusion: Counter-Strike 2 feels more like an unfinished tech demo on the Source 2 engine than a worthy successor. Those who loved CS:GO will miss many of the old strengths here. Maybe it will be better in the future - but right now it feels like a premature release that brings more frustration than joy."

193150358,1745113922,False,"[h1]The Same Game That Released in 2012[/h1]  CS:GO 2 is truly the Overwatch 2 of Valve. If you played CS:GO in 2012 then you played CS:GO 2 in 2025 and beyond. Literally Patrick Star logic ""What if we released the same game but put a 2 at the end of it!""  The only difference I can spot is the download size which is absurd since it does NOT look any better than it did in 2012. 60 gb for what??? Other than the size inflating larger than a furry oc with a growth fetish, it's the same exact outdated game. The same game that sweats have been playing since 2012 who love it because they figured out the ""strategy"". The same game with a phobia of aiming down any sight that isn't a scope. If you like Fallout 3 aiming then you will love CS:GO aiming. Nothing has changed and it's just as outdated and predatory as it was back then. A product of the early 2000s no sprint, no ads and insane recoil. Every match boils down to: early rounds, who can stop/crouch the fastest. And later rounds, who can line the sniper scope on the other guys body the fastest. Oh and don't worry. The absolutely bonkers skin black market still exists. But who cares because the only people who would spend $2.5k on a digital knife that you would never use in a 13 year old game is about as intelligent as an EA executive.    [h2]Conclusion[/h2]  CS:GO 2 is the same sh*tty game it was back then just fatter. Marginally fun to play with a full squad of friends but not much else. I couldn't imagine solo queing or playing this game longer than an hour. If you liked original CS:GO then you'll like CS:GO 2 because nothings changed. But if you took a break off CS:GO and are wondering if 2 is worth checking out then pass because it's not."
193107099,1745074594,True,"So... CS2. New engine, new smokes, new everything — except one thing: the cheaters are still here. 🧀  🔫 VACnet? Still on vacation. Every game feels like a lottery: will I face an actual team or a full stack of ESP-enjoyers? Spoiler: It’s always the ESP guys.  📉 Sub-tick system? On paper: revolutionary. In reality: works great if you're a time-traveler with 0ms ping and a LAN server in your basement. For the rest of us? Hitreg roulette.  💣 Competitive mode? Imagine CS:GO's ranked — but worse. Unbalanced teams, broken ranks, and the occasional lobby of future Twitch bans. Love it.  🎨 Sure, the graphics are great. Smokes are real. Guns look crispy. But… maybe focus on gameplay before photorealistic chicken feathers?  🧠 Simple solution: 💡 Just give us 120 tick + sub-tick (why not both?). 💡 And please, cut down those thousands of spaghetti-code servers. It’s not a buffet — just give us a few servers that actually work!  💀 CS:GO was better. It was like an old hoodie — worn out but warm and reliable.  🤷‍♂️ But hey… Nothing to do. This is the future.

192032552,1743849041,True,"Hacking in Counter-Strike is a huge problem that have caused many to quit the game. With Counter-Strike being so competitive, a hacker can really ruin your day. However, many players treat cheats as a joke, because they are misinformed about them. In this article we will go over all the hacks there are, how to spot CS:GO hackers, why you shouldn’t hack, and how to deal with a cheater. By the time you are done you will be a pro at dealing with those annoying scum bags!   Wallhacks First let’s review the most popular CS:GO hacks out there. Wallhacks are basically cheats that allow you to see players through walls and smokes, similar to spectator mode. These allow the cheater to hit insane wall bangs and pre fires and can be really maddening. On top of this, it’s hard to catch these hackers because they can simply say they got lucky when they hit these shots. Wall cheats are simple to use, so the users are often bad at disguising them, which is good for you.   Aimbots The next type of cheats we have to go over are aimbots. Aimbots are programs that move your crosshair right onto your opponent’s head and can be as subtle as a regular old flick to an insane half way across the map 180 no scope. Basically, you will get absolutely owned in every aim duel you take with these shady users.   Fast move The last type of assistance in this list are mobility cheats. These users can move faster than the average running speed and can “ghost” through walls. Basically, they get their inner Casper on and kill you by backstabbing you through a wall. All of these cheats are shady and unfair, and should not be used.   CS:GO hacks are very easy to use, which makes it really hard to end the blight that is defiling Counter-Strike. However, there is a bright spot. Because hacks are so easy to use, the downloaders are often blatant. Yes, spotting hackers is very easy once you know how and we will go over that soon. However, to all the possible cheaters out there, we as a community have a message for you. You are absolute jerks that no one likes and you will eventually be banned. If you are considering hacking, please don’t. It is annoying and ruins other people’s experience.   How do I spot a CS:GO hacker? That is the question many noobs ask when questioned about some doubts they had about cheaters. Well, we will go over that now so you can get on them right away. First of all, don’t report someone because they keep out aiming you. This will waste the Overwatch guy’s time and no one likes that one guy who accuses everyone. Only report someone if they are blatantly aim botting or walling. If you are not sure, simply record a GOTV demo of the footage and then make your decision. If the player hits one or two insane shots, they might just be lucky. Wait until you see a consistent suspicious pattern before reporting them.  Now you may be wondering how to report these bullies. Well, it is quite easy. Just find their name on the Tab menu, and right click on it. Click on submit a report and fill out the required info. Once you do this, a reputed member of the community will watch the suspicious uses footage and decide whether or not to ban them. This is called an Overwatch ban.   Types of punishment cs go vac banCheaters are punished in many different ways. The first type of ban is the VAC ban. These bans are when a computer system determines you are cheating. You are banned from competitive CS:GO and cannot trade any of your items. These bans are permanent, unappealable, and come with a trade ban that locks all your items into your account.  The next type of bans are Overwatch bans. These are community managed bans, where one user can report a user, and another can choose to ban him based on the evidence available. These are appealable but take forever due to a backlog of appeals. You don’t want to get either of these, as they basically ruin your ability to play Counter-Strike on those accounts.  How to solve the problem? Now you might wonder what Valve’s stance on this sensitive topic is. They are known to be absolutely no tolerance on cheaters and hate that their game is rife with them. So players don’t like cheats, and Valve doesn’t like them either. However, there will be those that will do it, and the best thing we can do is report and ban them.  A suggestion we have for dealing with hackers is to place them among other hackers. They will think that they are getting along unaffected while they are only being placed among other hackers. This will lower the amount of cheaters in regular servers as many cheaters have multiple accounts which they can use if one account is banned. A game that has used this system in the past is Titanfall, and I got the idea from the YouTube Warowl. It is a sensible idea that is easy to implement and would be very helpful."

191802120,1743602715,False,"After 20 years I have the biggest hate-love relationship with this game. CS has potential to be one of the best competitive online games out there, even at casual levels, but sadly is ruined by Valve giving zero f*cks about the rampant cheating problem. I truly think the situation is worse than ever before right now. VAC feels like a pony-sticker that has no actual meaning whatsoever: it doesn't ban people even when they spin and aimbot during a match. To add to the pain, Valve is not transparent nor do they seem to care about working a solution (ie. together with the community), but rather just let the problem be. Updates and tweaks to the game itself come and go, but there's NEVER an update or information about the progress of a working anti-cheat. Reporting a blatant cheater during a game seems to do absolutely nothing nor you are informed what happens to that player. It all seems like a smoke-screen to give the player a placebo effect that they did the right thing, but without closure. It's also infuriating that you cant blacklist people (ie. toxic teammates or hackers) so that you won't be queued with or against them in the future. This should be quite easy to implement and personally I wouldn't mind waiting in the queue a bit longer if it comes with it..   The game is 10/10 with its complex yet simple mechanics and ingame-meta, but honestly at this point the negatives outweight the positives. It's a -6/10 for me as long as the cheating is so present. Valve, get your sh*t together ffs."

191530332,1743307132,True,"CS2 Review – A Mixed Bag of Nostalgia and Frustration      I've been playing Counter-Strike for some time now and I was excited for CS2 to bring fresh changes to the series. While the game has some solid improvements, its current state is frustrating, especially due to bot farms (especially in ASIA server) and cheaters.      ### The Good 👍    - Gameplay & Gunplay: When you actually get into a fair match, the shooting mechanics feel great. The responsive gunplay and smooth movement make CS2 enjoyable.    - Updated Graphics: The new Source 2 engine makes the game look much better with improved lighting, map details, and overall polish.    - Potential to Be Great: If Valve cracks down on cheaters and bot farmers, CS2 could be the best version of Counter-Strike yet.      ### The Bad 👎    - Bot Farming from China 🇨🇳🤖: This is a huge issue. Many servers are flooded with bots farming cases, making it difficult to find real players. You either get stuck with bots or have to search endlessly for a proper match. It ruins the entire experience.    - Cheaters Still Everywhere 🏴‍☠️: Even with VAC, wallhacks and aimbots are way too common. It's disheartening when you just want a fair game.    - Matchmaking Feels Broken: Pairing with bot accounts or blatant cheaters is frustrating. Finding a decent, balanced match should not be this difficult.      ### Final Verdict    ⭐ 4/10 (for now). If Valve actually fights against bot farms and cheaters, CS2 has the potential to be amazing. But in its current state, the game feels more like a griefing simulator than a tactical shooter.      Would I recommend it? Only if you have patience… or if Valve fixes the problems."

You profit from the sale of cheats, you earn from new purchased accounts, as well as from lost inventory. Here’s how your anti-cheat system would look: SentinelGuard: Advanced Anti-Cheat System for CS2**   *(Kernel-Level + AI + Community-Driven)*    ## **1.

Cutting-Edge Detection Methods**    ### **A. Neural Cheat Detection**   ```python   # Detects AI-assisted aimbots via mouse movements   def is_ai_behavior(movements):       model = load_model('human_ai_classifier.h5')       return model.predict(movements) > 0.95  # 95% confidence threshold   ```    ### **B.

193374294,1745365570,False,"Multiplayer: Still Got Some Spark Counter-Strike (CS:GO or CS2) is one of those games you either like or totally get hooked on. The multiplayer is a gem: precise shooting, team strategies, and managing cash for weapons make every match engaging. Maps like Dust II and Mirage are designed for competition, keeping you on your toes. With CS2’s Source 2 engine, visuals and animations feel smoother and more modern. On paper, it’s a killer formula. Community: A Hellhole of Cheats and Toxicity But here’s the harsh truth: Counter-Strike’s community is an absolute trainwreck. It’s crawling with cheaters using blatant hacks like wallhacks and aimbots, ruining any fun. Matchmaking is a mess—either you’re stuck with cheaters or teammates who play like they’ve never touched a mouse. Worse, a bunch of shady players with toxic behavior and scams have dragged the game’s name through the mud. Sure, not everyone’s awful, but these rotten apples have made Counter-Strike infamous for all the wrong reasons. Valve seems asleep at the wheel; their anti-cheat system is a joke, and these issues have been festering for years. Verdict Counter-Strike has a gripping multiplayer, but its toxic community and rampant cheaters turn it into a nerve-wracking slog. With things this bad, I can’t recommend it to anyone. If you’ve got nerves of steel, you might enjoy a few hours, but you’ll likely get fed up with the cheats and toxicity fast. Score: 5/10"

The new Source 2 engine brings stunning lighting, sharper visuals, and cleaner maps without compromising the feel that made CS iconic.  ✅ Gunplay feels better than ever ✅ Smoke grenades are game-changers now (they interact with bullets and environment!) ✅ Matchmaking is faster and more balanced ✅ Movement and hit registration feel crisp ✅ Improved UI and stat tracking  Yeah, there are still some tweaks needed here and there, but Valve is clearly listening and improving it with each update. For anyone who’s been with CS since 1.6 or even just GO, this feels like the right step forward.  If you love tactical shooters with a high skill ceiling, this is still the gold standard. 💣🔥"

Considering one could live with the technical stuff lacking for a while this game is out for a year now and nothing has changed about it and AC is lacking more than it was in CS:GO already.

192532370,1744409167,True,"Counter-Strike 2 is the perfect game if you’ve ever wanted to spend 40 minutes being yelled at by a 14-year-old with the tactical instincts of a squirrel and the confidence of a Navy SEAL.    The graphics are excellent, which really helps when you want to watch your own ragdoll body flop over in glorious 1440p after peeking mid for the 37th time in a row. The lighting system is beautiful, too. I especially enjoy the detailed shadows and reflections — which I stare at for a solid 90% of the game because I’m dead.    Gameplay is exactly what you’d expect: two teams, one objective, and no one actually following the plan. Everyone has a microphone, and they all use it exclusively for ASMR chip crunching or motivational speeches like “bro why are you so bad.” Riveting.    Guns are varied and realistic. I appreciate the attention to detail — every weapon behaves differently, and none of them seem interested in hitting what I aim at. The AWP is a great choice if you enjoy standing still and being judged by five strangers every time you miss a shot worth $4,750.    There’s also a ping system, which is mostly used to mark bomb sites long after the bomb has exploded. A nice reminder of what could’ve been.    Occasionally, I win a match. I don’t know how. It just happens. Like lightning strikes, or someone actually using a smoke grenade properly.    Would recommend. Especially if you enjoy high-stress environments, mild emotional damage, and developing a lifelong distrust of random teammates."

It is a game filled with cheaters, a greedy company unable to deal with them, even worse than third parties.  Imagine you are  developing a game and third parties have a better service. Meaning Anti-Cheat even though Valve have way more capacity. This makes me very sad and angry. What a waste of time! (and some money) BUT TIME To sum it up: Loved this game for 15 years, over the years cheaters have become an increasing problem, Valve don't care. But love inherently makes you blind. Dopamine and siblings... They will get their moneyzz anyways. The community is too weak and addicted to gambling, it is not about the core anymore. What a shame this company has become, once a great mod.  From players for players? What a Joke! Go back to Hawaii and go    ..i.     yourselves."

I know it's not my internet nor my PC hardware as it's all overkill for this game. (1 gigabit internet, a RTX 4090, i9-10900k, and 32 GBs of DDR4 at 3200Mhz.)

191845977,1743646319,False,"You want to buy this game ? I'm gonna show you some tips for playing : - Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot. - If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy?"

191458408,1743244484,True,"Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)  As a fan of CS2, I’ve been really enjoying the gameplay, graphics, and overall improvements. The game itself has great potential, and it’s a fun, intense experience—exactly what you’d expect from the Counter-Strike series. However, there’s one major issue that’s been holding me back from fully enjoying the game: the VAC Anti-Cheat system.  I’ve been playing on the green trust factor, which is supposed to indicate a clean and fair environment, but unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be working as intended. Every day, I’m running into cheaters who are ruining the experience. The fact that VAC, a system that’s supposed to protect players from cheating, isn’t doing its job properly is incredibly frustrating. It’s making it difficult to truly enjoy the game when I’m constantly facing off against cheaters, and it takes away from the competitive spirit that CS2 should be about.  I hope that Valve addresses this issue soon because, until they do, it’s hard to recommend the game to anyone who wants a fair, cheat-free experience. The gameplay itself is fantastic, but the lack of effective anti-cheat is a real dealbreaker for me."

192569756,1744455669,True,"🧓 Review #1: Back in My Day, We Played 1.6 and We Liked It ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2/5 LAN Cables)  Counter-Strike 2, huh? Back in my day, it was 1.6, baby. We didn’t have smoke physics. We had square clouds that looked like a broken vape. And we liked it.  Let me walk you through my experience booting this thing up:  Step 1: Download a 50-gigabyte update to play a game I’ve been playing since Bush was president. Step 2: Try to find de_dust2. Step 3: Realize it’s been “reimagined” with lighting so realistic I need sunglasses indoors.  The guns? Too many buttons now. I tried to quickswitch with my old binds and instead threw a decoy grenade that sounded like a duck choking on a kazoo. And don’t get me started on the AWP. I used to one-tap dreams with that bad boy. Now it feels like it’s coated in molasses. Also, everyone jumps around corners like caffeinated kangaroos.  The players? Back in 2003, you LANed with your boys in someone’s mom’s basement, drinking flat Mountain Dew and screaming across the room. Now? Now I get headshot in 0.3 seconds by someone named ""xX420DankSniperXx"" using a $900 anime skin and a VPN from space.  Yes, the smoke physics are cool. Yes, the Source 2 engine is sleek. But it just feels wrong. Too clean. Too modern. I want jank. I want the raw Counter-Strike. I want to bunny hop off a crate and knife a dude in 4 pixels.  Bring back 1.6. Or at least give me the dignity of a server browser that doesn't feel like I'm filing taxes."

191651599,1743432243,True,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an adrenaline-pumping battle royale experience that truly sets the gold standard for its genre. From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."
192800060,1744726434,False,"After launching years ago, I continuously find hackers, aimbotters, wallers, and cheaters in almost every map i join. If you want yourself to be frustrated by continuous South East hackers and ruin your game, be my guest and play it. Loose your mind over every death you watch on your death cam, your attacker always look at your direction in close proximity. Sound sense is the worst, cant hear anything from enemy running to reload or whatever. I wont recommend playing this. Thoroughly frustrated by hackers."
193067984,1745029629,False,"I've been playing this game since 2018, and I really enjoyed it back then.

193017459,1744981349,False,"Can't select map. Game is flooded with bots. Body armor and helmets are just for show, they don't reduce damage.

Game decides whenever you shot is a hit or not, also determines the damage. If you value your nervous system you'll simply not play this game."
192370907,1744214497,False,"Full of cheater. Every session minimum 3-4 team using map, auto-aim, much life. Wait in zone 7-8 minutes.

192260718,1744075139,False,"This game really shows its age. The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."
191338264,1743117876,False,"1. Bullets can hit anyone from almost any distance without a scope. No, it's not your aiming; it's just a game mechanic that favors shooters.  2. Does the zone matter? No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job. Congratulations..."
193396865,1745398825,False,"So many microtransactions.    Core gameplay is almost fun, but the blue zones converge way too quick. You get 2 minutes of looting, then have to run for 10 minutes straight in order to get to the right zone. Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

193265577,1745242734,False,"PUBG cheaters, poor anti-cheat system Cheating in PUBG has been a persistent issue, with many players exploiting the game unfairly. The developers seem to be making ZERO efforts to combat these cheaters. They often impose only 1-day bans, like after a day they won't be cheating anymore(BIG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FACEPALM), cheaters will just return and continue their activities immediately. Additionally, the current anti-cheat system is so a$$ that's not even working, and fails to detect and prevent cheating effectively, leading to a frustrating experience for honest players.:steamthumbsdown::steamthumbsdown::steamthumbsdown::steamthumbsdown::steamthumbsdown:"

193113451,1745079322,True,Best F2P realistic battle royale game on market. Finally made all achievements after playing this game occasionally since 2018. But negative aspects is that there are a lot of tryhards and only few noobs.  And there is also a lot of cheaters.

I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
192842669,1744773429,True,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

192796243,1744722563,True,I like the gunplay which has more realistic velocities and bullet drops.

But the core of this game sets it apart from the rest.

The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

I’ve always aimed to play fairly and respectfully, and I take great pride in maintaining a clean gaming record.  The game in question was one where I performed well, and I understand that sometimes strong performances can raise suspicion. However, I assure you that my gameplay was entirely legitimate.  I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay. I am happy to provide any further information you might need to support this review.  Thank you for your time and for the work you do to keep PUBG fair and enjoyable.

192024922,1743840681,False,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"". Thanks to this, those who play the game badly started playing it frequently. Fix this because I don't enjoy the game. No one who plays the game well enjoys it this way."

These small moments keep me coming back for more and they truly make the game. There's a lot to dislike but i think there is equally a lot to like as well. It has a steep learning curve, but once you climb that hill, it gets much more enjoyable.

The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots.

Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory.

191121971,1742871596,False,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

191699670,1743483485,True,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."
192668572,1744557165,False,"Dear Support Team,  I am contacting you regarding the permanent ban on my PUBG account. I paid €30 for the game, have over 500 hours of playtime, and this is the only game I actively play.  I was banned for allegedly violating the rules, but I have never used any cheats, third-party software, or knowingly broken any rules. If there has been a mistake or my account was flagged in error, I kindly ask you to review the case once more.  If the ban remains in place, I believe I am entitled to a refund, as I have been unfairly excluded from a game I paid for and invested a lot of time into.  Thank you in advance for your understanding, and I look forward to your response"

192001503,1743812517,True,The benchmark for the whole Battle Royale experience. Still holds up 8 years later. Realistic enough to scare away small children so game for 16 years and up. Very immersive at best with team play focus.

I still do, but we need to talk about the elephant in the room: This game has been ruined by a gigantic cheating problem and the developers aren't combating the problem good enough. Weekly, the developer posts that they ban 10% of it's player base because they are detected as cheaters. Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil. If you play this game as-intended without hacks, you are going to be at a massive disadvantage.    Can fun be had with this game? Yes, but for the sake of your sanity I would recommend you get hooked on another title,.. Unless you can come to terms with getting killed by a hacker in half of your engagements."

A total cheat fest, getting snapped through windows, aim bot, wall hack, people targeting me half way through the map, 500-600 meters head shots with a single shot...100% accuracy is insane.    Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers.

Please stop putting lipstick on a pig, focusing on cosmetic things that don't matter, and concentrate on the core game again.

The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well.

It's janky  Movements have that low quality underwater vibe going  Gunplay is aggressively mid  Looting is tedious and has too many steps  Character customization is grossly monetized  Sound design is dogshit    There's no way I'll ever recommend this turd to anyone... And yet, every 2 to 3 years, I forget how shitty this game is, I reinstall it, play a few matches, remember how ass it is and uninstall it.

191651599,1743432243,True,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an adrenaline-pumping battle royale experience that truly sets the gold standard for its genre. From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."

Loose your mind over every death you watch on your death cam, your attacker always look at your direction in close proximity. Sound sense is the worst, cant hear anything from enemy running to reload or whatever. I wont recommend playing this. Thoroughly frustrated by hackers."
193067984,1745029629,False,"I've been playing this game since 2018, and I really enjoyed it back then.

I’m probably uninstalling the game soon."
191026374,1742764500,False,"I've been playing PUBG for years, and it used to be one of the best battle royale games out there. However, ever since the game was acquired by Tencent, it has become a disaster.  Cheater Infestation – The anti-cheat system is almost nonexistent. The game is flooded with hackers, especially from regions where cheating is rampant. Reporting does nothing, and Tencent seems to care more about making money than fixing this issue.  Horrible Optimization – The game runs worse than ever. Lag, frame drops, and crashes are a constant problem, even on high-end systems. Instead of fixing performance issues, the developers keep pushing out more skins.  Unbalanced Matchmaking – Skill-based matchmaking is broken, leading to frustratingly unfair matches. You either get paired with complete beginners or ridiculously skilled opponents, making the game unenjoyable.  Lack of Meaningful Updates – Instead of improving core gameplay, Tencent keeps recycling old content and focusing on cosmetics. Other battle royale games have innovated, while PUBG has become stagnant.  Ever since Tencent took over, PUBG has turned into a cheater-filled cash grab. If you're looking for a fair and competitive battle royale experience, look elsewhere."
189858636,1741599644,False,"No.  I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all. But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.  And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).  The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers. Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.  But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game. I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.  Yes the game has some anti cheat measures, but it does not work properly and when a cheater finally gets banned it is mostly temporarily, and they will be back cheating again in a couple of days. Also there is no stopping someone from having multiple accounts."

The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."

No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job. Congratulations..."

It took me saving and slowing down the footage to truly understand just how bad the game is rigged to make mobile players not want to an hero themselves playing against keyboard and mouse. I urge you to stop supporting things that make your attention the product.

188165825,1739849038,False,Worst game ever. More cheaters then any game ever. I think the developers build the cheats and sell them themselves or get a family member to do it and slip them the code changes. Then they pretend to care and claim they ban people. After they made it free to play it got even worse. Don't recommend anyone play this game.

193396865,1745398825,False,"So many microtransactions.    Core gameplay is almost fun, but the blue zones converge way too quick. You get 2 minutes of looting, then have to run for 10 minutes straight in order to get to the right zone. Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
192842669,1744773429,True,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

192796243,1744722563,True,I like the gunplay which has more realistic velocities and bullet drops.   Every round has it's own unique challenges and allows me to feel like every game is a fresh adventure even if it is the same map.  Alike any other studio there is things they could be doing better.

The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

I believe this action may have been taken in error, as I have never used any form of cheating software, nor do I have any knowledge of how to download or use such tools. I’ve always aimed to play fairly and respectfully, and I take great pride in maintaining a clean gaming record.  The game in question was one where I performed well, and I understand that sometimes strong performances can raise suspicion. However, I assure you that my gameplay was entirely legitimate.  I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay. I am happy to provide any further information you might need to support this review.  Thank you for your time and for the work you do to keep PUBG fair and enjoyable. I look forward to your response.  Warm regards, Team7Nijuri"
192024922,1743840681,False,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"". Thanks to this, those who play the game badly started playing it frequently. Fix this because I don't enjoy the game. No one who plays the game well enjoys it this way."
191997426,1743807591,True,"This game is like smoking crack. Its painful 90 percent of the time but its that 10 percent, where your in an intense gun fight, or landing all your shots or you have a great random group of players who communicate well and help out the team, or you gifted the circle late game and are set up to win. These small moments keep me coming back for more and they truly make the game. There's a lot to dislike but i think there is equally a lot to like as well. It has a steep learning curve, but once you climb that hill, it gets much more enjoyable. Its hands down the only game I'v ever played where at moments,  it has had my heart literally beating out of my chest."

It's so fucking gᾱy now; you'll be watching TV and chatting to people on Discord before you know it. I had to go for 3 long walks in the forest after playing this game ONCE in order to clear the mind viruses from my head. I shudder to think of what this could do to a lower IQ individual with little knowledge of corporate slop electromagnet hypnosis. Stay safe, and never touch this game.

191198725,1742959392,True,"I’ve got over 1,400 hours in PUBG, and I love the thrill of jumping in with nothing, scavenging for gear, and hoping my teammates have microphones. The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots. It got frustrating, and that’s what pushed me away from the game.  10/10 would recommend if the hackers weren’t an issue. It’s a solid game, just needs to fix the cheating problem."
191197085,1742957074,True,A lot less hackers than COD. Keeping things fresh. Better game experience than other FPS games for myself.

You can Hot drop to one location and have a person pick up a mk12 and aimbot you and your entire squad within 30 seconds. Doesn't happen all the time but squads usually are all hacking when they do.  Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory. If you're serious about fair gameplay this isn't the game for you. If you're not, Go download Epic Games and install a copy there and treat this like GTA 5."

191121971,1742871596,False,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

We do NOT want any more shiny drop box or firework animations but proper optimization."
191699670,1743483485,True,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."

Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil. If you play this game as-intended without hacks, you are going to be at a massive disadvantage.    Can fun be had with this game?

Well, the first match I played, I won. The 2nd after 10 kills I was top 3, 3rd one I won with 14 kills, great. Suddenly, everything started to decline. A total cheat fest, getting snapped through windows, aim bot, wall hack, people targeting me half way through the map, 500-600 meters head shots with a single shot...100% accuracy is insane.    Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers. Pretty appalling state considering the game has been out for 7 years and they ""ban"" 60k hackers a week.    It's depressing."

Please stop putting lipstick on a pig, focusing on cosmetic things that don't matter, and concentrate on the core game again.

On the other hand I have also felt like a peasant dragged through the slop pits in the medieval times as the crowd shames me through the street for being so god awful at this game.    Game makes you think and that is what matters for an engaging experience of battle royal.  Also the adrenaline rush will kill you in final zone.

I played for 4000 hours and not about to stop. It feels like a competitive, horror survival game. There is an accent on realism which makes it very immersive. The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well. Just be aware: it's HARD, and also you need a pretty good PC, you can play aggressively full squad! ore alone in singel mode ore maybe Duo and be Sanke in the Grass :D"

190630291,1742394869,False,"I mean, this game is objectively terrible.     It's janky  Movements have that low quality underwater vibe going  Gunplay is aggressively mid  Looting is tedious and has too many steps  Character customization is grossly monetized  Sound design is dogshit    There's no way I'll ever recommend this turd to anyone... And yet, every 2 to 3 years, I forget how shitty this game is, I reinstall it, play a few matches, remember how ass it is and uninstall it.    You should buy it just so you can play for a bit and go ""Damn, this fucking idiot in the reviews was right"""
191651599,1743432243,True,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an adrenaline-pumping battle royale experience that truly sets the gold standard for its genre. From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."

If you want yourself to be frustrated by continuous South East hackers and ruin your game, be my guest and play it. Loose your mind over every death you watch on your death cam, your attacker always look at your direction in close proximity. Sound sense is the worst, cant hear anything from enemy running to reload or whatever. I wont recommend playing this. Thoroughly frustrated by hackers."
193067984,1745029629,False,"I've been playing this game since 2018, and I really enjoyed it back then. But as time goes on, especially now, the game has just gotten worse — unstable, laggy, tons of input lag, filled with trash battle passes full of pinky stuff and it's getting more and more... gay. I’m probably uninstalling the game soon."
191026374,1742764500,False,"I've been playing PUBG for years, and it used to be one of the best battle royale games out there. However, ever since the game was acquired by Tencent, it has become a disaster.  Cheater Infestation – The anti-cheat system is almost nonexistent. The game is flooded with hackers, especially from regions where cheating is rampant. Reporting does nothing, and Tencent seems to care more about making money than fixing this issue.  Horrible Optimization – The game runs worse than ever. Lag, frame drops, and crashes are a constant problem, even on high-end systems. Instead of fixing performance issues, the developers keep pushing out more skins.  Unbalanced Matchmaking – Skill-based matchmaking is broken, leading to frustratingly unfair matches. You either get paired with complete beginners or ridiculously skilled opponents, making the game unenjoyable.  Lack of Meaningful Updates – Instead of improving core gameplay, Tencent keeps recycling old content and focusing on cosmetics. Other battle royale games have innovated, while PUBG has become stagnant.  Ever since Tencent took over, PUBG has turned into a cheater-filled cash grab. If you're looking for a fair and competitive battle royale experience, look elsewhere."
189858636,1741599644,False,"No.  I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all. But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.  And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).  The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers. Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.  But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game. I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.  Yes the game has some anti cheat measures, but it does not work properly and when a cheater finally gets banned it is mostly temporarily, and they will be back cheating again in a couple of days. Also there is no stopping someone from having multiple accounts."

192410856,1744264581,False,"Lets be real, the movement is hilariously horrible. The Audio is completely misleading and will have you spinning in circles. Not even worth buying the game at a discounted price. As of 2025, I would advise staying away from this game."
193017459,1744981349,False,"Can't select map. Game is flooded with bots. Body armor and helmets are just for show, they don't reduce damage. Small caliber SMGs and HANDGUNS make more damage than bigger caliber assault rifles. ""Skill based matchmaking"" in this game is a joke.

Much bag capacity more than 10 grenade etc. Reporting but nothing happening very seldom temporary for just 1 day! Almost never permanent ban. It was very good several years ago but now i dont advice to anybody play this game."

188598460,1740332022,False,Trash game. Full of cheaters. Only reason I play with my friends is because nothing else has come out thats worth while in the last 5 years and this game is consistent. Consistently trash but consistent none the less.
192260718,1744075139,False,"This game really shows its age. The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."

191338264,1743117876,False,"1. Bullets can hit anyone from almost any distance without a scope. No, it's not your aiming; it's just a game mechanic that favors shooters.  2. Does the zone matter? No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job. Congratulations..."

188623087,1740355663,False,supposedly its my ISP but this game is flawed. i have to exit to desktop after each raid then either plug in or unplug my ethernet cable before launching the game again. i've done EVERYTHING i can think of under the sun to fix it but this is my reality so i wouldn't reccomend this game to you if you use Spectrum as your ISP.

If you think that the people who bought this game from the original owners are not using machine learned matchmaking algorithms to keep you ""engaged,"" you are smoking crack. It took me saving and slowing down the footage to truly understand just how bad the game is rigged to make mobile players not want to an hero themselves playing against keyboard and mouse. I urge you to stop supporting things that make your attention the product. The only reason they want your attention is not because they enjoy the thing they create but it is to steal your time and entice you to buy useless pixels on a game that will inevitably die."
188165825,1739849038,False,Worst game ever. More cheaters then any game ever. I think the developers build the cheats and sell them themselves or get a family member to do it and slip them the code changes. Then they pretend to care and claim they ban people.

You get 2 minutes of looting, then have to run for 10 minutes straight in order to get to the right zone. Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

193113451,1745079322,True,Best F2P realistic battle royale game on market. Finally made all achievements after playing this game occasionally since 2018. But negative aspects is that there are a lot of tryhards and only few noobs.  And there is also a lot of cheaters.
193079430,1745044703,True,i really enjoy this game. recently started playing again and im having alot of fun with these new maps.
193024846,1744987829,True,sometimes its very fun game to play but sometimes (mostly when playing ranked) its shit game because of 5th tier players who has no life and dont know what is grass

192852500,1744790577,True,REALISTIC!!! best game as an ADULT and a FATHER.
192844633,1744776470,True,"Oof, I need to write a review after saying I would recommend? Okay, I guess I'll share a little : ) .    This game is fun, solid, robust, and reliable. I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
192842669,1744773429,True,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

192796243,1744722563,True,I like the gunplay which has more realistic velocities and bullet drops.   Every round has it's own unique challenges and allows me to feel like every game is a fresh adventure even if it is the same map.  Alike any other studio there is things they could be doing better.  But the core of this game sets it apart from the rest.

192753925,1744659711,True,"PUBG is a beautiful mess where you drop out of a plane, hit the ground running, and die to a guy with a crowbar who somehow looted a whole town in 12 seconds. The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

Krafton claims to be ""concerned"" about the lack of players on the Oceanic server but continues to show complete and utter disdain for them.<br>Instead of giving me a new anime-type skin that costs $10-$20 real dollars, may I have some bug fixes related to connection and performance issues?

I believe this action may have been taken in error, as I have never used any form of cheating software, nor do I have any knowledge of how to download or use such tools. I’ve always aimed to play fairly and respectfully, and I take great pride in maintaining a clean gaming record.  The game in question was one where I performed well, and I understand that sometimes strong performances can raise suspicion. However, I assure you that my gameplay was entirely legitimate.  I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay. I am happy to provide any further information you might need to support this review.  Thank you for your time and for the work you do to keep PUBG fair and enjoyable. I look forward to your response.  Warm regards, Team7Nijuri"
192024922,1743840681,False,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"". Thanks to this, those who play the game badly started playing it frequently. Fix this because I don't enjoy the game. No one who plays the game well enjoys it this way."
191997426,1743807591,True,"This game is like smoking crack. Its painful 90 percent of the time but its that 10 percent, where your in an intense gun fight, or landing all your shots or you have a great random group of players who communicate well and help out the team, or you gifted the circle late game and are set up to win. These small moments keep me coming back for more and they truly make the game. There's a lot to dislike but i think there is equally a lot to like as well. It has a steep learning curve, but once you climb that hill, it gets much more enjoyable. Its hands down the only game I'v ever played where at moments,  it has had my heart literally beating out of my chest."

It's so fucking gᾱy now; you'll be watching TV and chatting to people on Discord before you know it. I had to go for 3 long walks in the forest after playing this game ONCE in order to clear the mind viruses from my head. I shudder to think of what this could do to a lower IQ individual with little knowledge of corporate slop electromagnet hypnosis. Stay safe, and never touch this game.

191198725,1742959392,True,"I’ve got over 1,400 hours in PUBG, and I love the thrill of jumping in with nothing, scavenging for gear, and hoping my teammates have microphones. The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots. It got frustrating, and that’s what pushed me away from the game.  10/10 would recommend if the hackers weren’t an issue. It’s a solid game, just needs to fix the cheating problem."

Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory.

191121971,1742871596,False,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

191473310,1743257800,False,"It is March 2025 and PUBG;    -is still not optimized properly  -depends heavily on single CPU core usage  -is still stuttering and laging even with the latest hardware, updated drivers and proper internet  -is unable to ban cheaters coming back to game    I have been playing this garbage for many years since it first came out and I have to say it is utterly dissapointing what devolopers are doing. We do NOT want any more shiny drop box or firework animations but proper optimization."
191699670,1743483485,True,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."
192668572,1744557165,False,"Dear Support Team,  I am contacting you regarding the permanent ban on my PUBG account. I paid €30 for the game, have over 500 hours of playtime, and this is the only game I actively play.  I was banned for allegedly violating the rules, but I have never used any cheats, third-party software, or knowingly broken any rules. If there has been a mistake or my account was flagged in error, I kindly ask you to review the case once more.  If the ban remains in place, I believe I am entitled to a refund, as I have been unfairly excluded from a game I paid for and invested a lot of time into.  Thank you in advance for your understanding, and I look forward to your response"

I still do, but we need to talk about the elephant in the room: This game has been ruined by a gigantic cheating problem and the developers aren't combating the problem good enough. Weekly, the developer posts that they ban 10% of it's player base because they are detected as cheaters. Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil. If you play this game as-intended without hacks, you are going to be at a massive disadvantage.    Can fun be had with this game? Yes, but for the sake of your sanity I would recommend you get hooked on another title,.. Unless you can come to terms with getting killed by a hacker in half of your engagements."

A total cheat fest, getting snapped through windows, aim bot, wall hack, people targeting me half way through the map, 500-600 meters head shots with a single shot...100% accuracy is insane.    Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers.

Please stop putting lipstick on a pig, focusing on cosmetic things that don't matter, and concentrate on the core game again.     I worked in the gaming industry for a long time, and been a gamer much, much longer, and I've never once heard of downtime like this, let alone consistently happening without any new content.

The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well. Just be aware: it's HARD, and also you need a pretty good PC, you can play aggressively full squad! ore alone in singel mode ore maybe Duo and be Sanke in the Grass :D"
192764523,1744671958,False,After 3200 hours of ranked games and really trying to scale I decided that I will uninstall this game because its full of hackers and noone's doing anything about it...its sad bcuz its a nice game but not worth it! AVOID THIS GAME
191287102,1743068717,False,Fix your shit ass game. Having to open and close the game over and over hoping it won't get stuck on a gray screen and just let me in to the main menu for a 7 year old game is comical. 50/50 chance it does the same after every game. What a joke
190630291,1742394869,False,"I mean, this game is objectively terrible.     It's janky  Movements have that low quality underwater vibe going  Gunplay is aggressively mid  Looting is tedious and has too many steps  Character customization is grossly monetized  Sound design is dogshit    There's no way I'll ever recommend this turd to anyone... And yet, every 2 to 3 years, I forget how shitty this game is, I reinstall it, play a few matches, remember how ass it is and uninstall it.    You should buy it just so you can play for a bit and go ""Damn, this fucking idiot in the reviews was right"""
191651599,1743432243,True,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an adrenaline-pumping battle royale experience that truly sets the gold standard for its genre. From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."
192800060,1744726434,False,"After launching years ago, I continuously find hackers, aimbotters, wallers, and cheaters in almost every map i join. If you want yourself to be frustrated by continuous South East hackers and ruin your game, be my guest and play it. Loose your mind over every death you watch on your death cam, your attacker always look at your direction in close proximity. Sound sense is the worst, cant hear anything from enemy running to reload or whatever. I wont recommend playing this. Thoroughly frustrated by hackers."
193067984,1745029629,False,"I've been playing this game since 2018, and I really enjoyed it back then. But as time goes on, especially now, the game has just gotten worse — unstable, laggy, tons of input lag, filled with trash battle passes full of pinky stuff and it's getting more and more... gay. I’m probably uninstalling the game soon."
191026374,1742764500,False,"I've been playing PUBG for years, and it used to be one of the best battle royale games out there. However, ever since the game was acquired by Tencent, it has become a disaster.  Cheater Infestation – The anti-cheat system is almost nonexistent. The game is flooded with hackers, especially from regions where cheating is rampant. Reporting does nothing, and Tencent seems to care more about making money than fixing this issue.  Horrible Optimization – The game runs worse than ever. Lag, frame drops, and crashes are a constant problem, even on high-end systems. Instead of fixing performance issues, the developers keep pushing out more skins.  Unbalanced Matchmaking – Skill-based matchmaking is broken, leading to frustratingly unfair matches. You either get paired with complete beginners or ridiculously skilled opponents, making the game unenjoyable.  Lack of Meaningful Updates – Instead of improving core gameplay, Tencent keeps recycling old content and focusing on cosmetics. Other battle royale games have innovated, while PUBG has become stagnant.  Ever since Tencent took over, PUBG has turned into a cheater-filled cash grab. If you're looking for a fair and competitive battle royale experience, look elsewhere."
189858636,1741599644,False,"No.  I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all. But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.  And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).  The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers. Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.  But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game. I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.  Yes the game has some anti cheat measures, but it does not work properly and when a cheater finally gets banned it is mostly temporarily, and they will be back cheating again in a couple of days. Also there is no stopping someone from having multiple accounts."

192260718,1744075139,False,"This game really shows its age. The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."

191338264,1743117876,False,"1. Bullets can hit anyone from almost any distance without a scope. No, it's not your aiming; it's just a game mechanic that favors shooters.  2. Does the zone matter? No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job. Congratulations..."

188623087,1740355663,False,supposedly its my ISP but this game is flawed. i have to exit to desktop after each raid then either plug in or unplug my ethernet cable before launching the game again. i've done EVERYTHING i can think of under the sun to fix it but this is my reality so i wouldn't reccomend this game to you if you use Spectrum as your ISP.

If you think that the people who bought this game from the original owners are not using machine learned matchmaking algorithms to keep you ""engaged,"" you are smoking crack. It took me saving and slowing down the footage to truly understand just how bad the game is rigged to make mobile players not want to an hero themselves playing against keyboard and mouse. I urge you to stop supporting things that make your attention the product. The only reason they want your attention is not because they enjoy the thing they create but it is to steal your time and entice you to buy useless pixels on a game that will inevitably die."
188165825,1739849038,False,Worst game ever. More cheaters then any game ever.

You get 2 minutes of looting, then have to run for 10 minutes straight in order to get to the right zone. Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
192842669,1744773429,True,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

192796243,1744722563,True,I like the gunplay which has more realistic velocities and bullet drops.   Every round has it's own unique challenges and allows me to feel like every game is a fresh adventure even if it is the same map.  Alike any other studio there is things they could be doing better.

The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

Right now i got GTX 950 and lets see whats happening and i saw the most unfair unbalanced gameplay. I wish 2017 was very new encountering newer players that are fun not skilled.

I believe this action may have been taken in error, as I have never used any form of cheating software, nor do I have any knowledge of how to download or use such tools. I’ve always aimed to play fairly and respectfully, and I take great pride in maintaining a clean gaming record.  The game in question was one where I performed well, and I understand that sometimes strong performances can raise suspicion. However, I assure you that my gameplay was entirely legitimate.  I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay. I am happy to provide any further information you might need to support this review.  Thank you for your time and for the work you do to keep PUBG fair and enjoyable. I look forward to your response.  Warm regards, Team7Nijuri"
192024922,1743840681,False,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"". Thanks to this, those who play the game badly started playing it frequently. Fix this because I don't enjoy the game. No one who plays the game well enjoys it this way."
191997426,1743807591,True,"This game is like smoking crack. Its painful 90 percent of the time but its that 10 percent, where your in an intense gun fight, or landing all your shots or you have a great random group of players who communicate well and help out the team, or you gifted the circle late game and are set up to win. These small moments keep me coming back for more and they truly make the game. There's a lot to dislike but i think there is equally a lot to like as well. It has a steep learning curve, but once you climb that hill, it gets much more enjoyable. Its hands down the only game I'v ever played where at moments,  it has had my heart literally beating out of my chest."

It's so fucking gᾱy now; you'll be watching TV and chatting to people on Discord before you know it. I had to go for 3 long walks in the forest after playing this game ONCE in order to clear the mind viruses from my head. I shudder to think of what this could do to a lower IQ individual with little knowledge of corporate slop electromagnet hypnosis. Stay safe, and never touch this game. By merely thinking about it, you are weaving a nest in your mind for a demon to inhabit."

They neglected the game and it quickly died everywhere except asia. Still full of hackers."

191433505,1743216193,True,"This game is really fun, I've been playing it for years on and off. It's come a long ways in terms of network code and playability. The gunplay feels way more fair and balanced than Warzone, which makes me want to throw my keyboard out the window."

191198725,1742959392,True,"I’ve got over 1,400 hours in PUBG, and I love the thrill of jumping in with nothing, scavenging for gear, and hoping my teammates have microphones. The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots. It got frustrating, and that’s what pushed me away from the game.  10/10 would recommend if the hackers weren’t an issue. It’s a solid game, just needs to fix the cheating problem."
191197085,1742957074,True,A lot less hackers than COD. Keeping things fresh. Better game experience than other FPS games for myself.
191194188,1742953112,False,"1/10 Because the Devs cannot get a handle on banning and preventing hackers. You can Hot drop to one location and have a person pick up a mk12 and aimbot you and your entire squad within 30 seconds. Doesn't happen all the time but squads usually are all hacking when they do.  Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory. If you're serious about fair gameplay this isn't the game for you. If you're not, Go download Epic Games and install a copy there and treat this like GTA 5."

191121971,1742871596,False,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

We do NOT want any more shiny drop box or firework animations but proper optimization."
191699670,1743483485,True,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."
192668572,1744557165,False,"Dear Support Team,  I am contacting you regarding the permanent ban on my PUBG account.

Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil. If you play this game as-intended without hacks, you are going to be at a massive disadvantage.    Can fun be had with this game?

Whine more and there be less. - Not optimized.... no, you need a better computer. Can hotspot with my phone, and I can use my 6 year old computer. Its not the game. It's your bloody computer. - Pink and anime.... It's an Asian company. Should others complain when there an Western concept event. Grow up or get Kendrick Lamar-ed.... - Lastly, yes some outdated issues. You not wrong. There been revisions, map updates, new guns. But there could have added another map or two. Environmental destruction should have been implemented earlier, etc.   Only played in the NA and Asia servers.

Well, the first match I played, I won. The 2nd after 10 kills I was top 3, 3rd one I won with 14 kills, great. Suddenly, everything started to decline. A total cheat fest, getting snapped through windows, aim bot, wall hack, people targeting me half way through the map, 500-600 meters head shots with a single shot...100% accuracy is insane.    Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers. Pretty appalling state considering the game has been out for 7 years and they ""ban"" 60k hackers a week.    It's depressing."

Please stop putting lipstick on a pig, focusing on cosmetic things that don't matter, and concentrate on the core game again.     I worked in the gaming industry for a long time, and been a gamer much, much longer, and I've never once heard of downtime like this, let alone consistently happening without any new content.

On the other hand I have also felt like a peasant dragged through the slop pits in the medieval times as the crowd shames me through the street for being so god awful at this game.    Game makes you think and that is what matters for an engaging experience of battle royal.  Also the adrenaline rush will kill you in final zone. Had a dude light up a dead body with an MG as I proceeded to throw a grenade over said body for the kill. 10/10 would Pan again.
186690765,1738173351,False,"bad movement and clunky gameplay, this game with modern engine would be 10/10 but game got old"

188763167,1740530230,True,"I think it's the fundamental game of Battle Royale! It's so much fun and money is not a waste! I really recommend it! Amazing game. I played for 4000 hours and not about to stop. It feels like a competitive, horror survival game. There is an accent on realism which makes it very immersive. The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well. Just be aware: it's HARD, and also you need a pretty good PC, you can play aggressively full squad! ore alone in singel mode ore maybe Duo and be Sanke in the Grass :D"
192764523,1744671958,False,After 3200 hours of ranked games and really trying to scale I decided that I will uninstall this game because its full of hackers and noone's doing anything about it...its sad bcuz its a nice game but not worth it! AVOID THIS GAME

190630291,1742394869,False,"I mean, this game is objectively terrible.     It's janky  Movements have that low quality underwater vibe going  Gunplay is aggressively mid  Looting is tedious and has too many steps  Character customization is grossly monetized  Sound design is dogshit    There's no way I'll ever recommend this turd to anyone... And yet, every 2 to 3 years, I forget how shitty this game is, I reinstall it, play a few matches, remember how ass it is and uninstall it.    You should buy it just so you can play for a bit and go ""Damn, this fucking idiot in the reviews was right"""
191651599,1743432243,True,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an adrenaline-pumping battle royale experience that truly sets the gold standard for its genre. From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."
192800060,1744726434,False,"After launching years ago, I continuously find hackers, aimbotters, wallers, and cheaters in almost every map i join. If you want yourself to be frustrated by continuous South East hackers and ruin your game, be my guest and play it. Loose your mind over every death you watch on your death cam, your attacker always look at your direction in close proximity. Sound sense is the worst, cant hear anything from enemy running to reload or whatever. I wont recommend playing this. Thoroughly frustrated by hackers."
193067984,1745029629,False,"I've been playing this game since 2018, and I really enjoyed it back then. But as time goes on, especially now, the game has just gotten worse — unstable, laggy, tons of input lag, filled with trash battle passes full of pinky stuff and it's getting more and more... gay. I’m probably uninstalling the game soon."
191026374,1742764500,False,"I've been playing PUBG for years, and it used to be one of the best battle royale games out there. However, ever since the game was acquired by Tencent, it has become a disaster.  Cheater Infestation – The anti-cheat system is almost nonexistent. The game is flooded with hackers, especially from regions where cheating is rampant. Reporting does nothing, and Tencent seems to care more about making money than fixing this issue.  Horrible Optimization – The game runs worse than ever. Lag, frame drops, and crashes are a constant problem, even on high-end systems. Instead of fixing performance issues, the developers keep pushing out more skins.  Unbalanced Matchmaking – Skill-based matchmaking is broken, leading to frustratingly unfair matches. You either get paired with complete beginners or ridiculously skilled opponents, making the game unenjoyable.  Lack of Meaningful Updates – Instead of improving core gameplay, Tencent keeps recycling old content and focusing on cosmetics. Other battle royale games have innovated, while PUBG has become stagnant.  Ever since Tencent took over, PUBG has turned into a cheater-filled cash grab. If you're looking for a fair and competitive battle royale experience, look elsewhere."
189858636,1741599644,False,"No.  I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all. But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.  And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).  The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers. Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.  But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game. I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.  Yes the game has some anti cheat measures, but it does not work properly and when a cheater finally gets banned it is mostly temporarily, and they will be back cheating again in a couple of days. Also there is no stopping someone from having multiple accounts."
193027796,1744990275,False,"really bad game, mono sound you cant tell where you getting shot from. and really poor servers mostly bots are running."
192410856,1744264581,False,"Lets be real, the movement is hilariously horrible. The Audio is completely misleading and will have you spinning in circles. Not even worth buying the game at a discounted price. As of 2025, I would advise staying away from this game."
193017459,1744981349,False,"Can't select map. Game is flooded with bots. Body armor and helmets are just for show, they don't reduce damage. Small caliber SMGs and HANDGUNS make more damage than bigger caliber assault rifles. ""Skill based matchmaking"" in this game is a joke. Game decides whenever you shot is a hit or not, also determines the damage. If you value your nervous system you'll simply not play this game."
192370907,1744214497,False,"Full of cheater. Every session minimum 3-4 team using map, auto-aim, much life. Wait in zone 7-8 minutes. Much bag capacity more than 10 grenade etc. Reporting but nothing happening very seldom temporary for just 1 day! Almost never permanent ban. It was very good several years ago but now i dont advice to anybody play this game."
192043487,1743859170,False,"Casual is broken because everyone bots, ranking is broken because everyone has a rank 10 times higher. Probably game is dead"
188598460,1740332022,False,Trash game. Full of cheaters. Only reason I play with my friends is because nothing else has come out thats worth while in the last 5 years and this game is consistent. Consistently trash but consistent none the less.
192260718,1744075139,False,"This game really shows its age. The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."

191338264,1743117876,False,"1. Bullets can hit anyone from almost any distance without a scope. No, it's not your aiming; it's just a game mechanic that favors shooters.  2. Does the zone matter? No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job. Congratulations..."

188623087,1740355663,False,supposedly its my ISP but this game is flawed. i have to exit to desktop after each raid then either plug in or unplug my ethernet cable before launching the game again. i've done EVERYTHING i can think of under the sun to fix it but this is my reality so i wouldn't reccomend this game to you if you use Spectrum as your ISP.

188373092,1740094699,False,"I played literally 300 hours of this game when it first came out I payed the money on release and it was something truly special. If you think that the people who bought this game from the original owners are not using machine learned matchmaking algorithms to keep you ""engaged,"" you are smoking crack. It took me saving and slowing down the footage to truly understand just how bad the game is rigged to make mobile players not want to an hero themselves playing against keyboard and mouse. I urge you to stop supporting things that make your attention the product. The only reason they want your attention is not because they enjoy the thing they create but it is to steal your time and entice you to buy useless pixels on a game that will inevitably die."
188165825,1739849038,False,Worst game ever. More cheaters then any game ever. I think the developers build the cheats and sell them themselves or get a family member to do it and slip them the code changes. Then they pretend to care and claim they ban people.

You get 2 minutes of looting, then have to run for 10 minutes straight in order to get to the right zone. Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

The developers seem to be making ZERO efforts to combat these cheaters. They often impose only 1-day bans, like after a day they won't be cheating anymore(BIG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FACEPALM), cheaters will just return and continue their activities immediately. Additionally, the current anti-cheat system is so a$$ that's not even working, and fails to detect and prevent cheating effectively, leading to a frustrating experience for honest players.:steamthumbsdown::steamthumbsdown::steamthumbsdown::steamthumbsdown::steamthumbsdown:"

192844633,1744776470,True,"Oof, I need to write a review after saying I would recommend? Okay, I guess I'll share a little : ) .    This game is fun, solid, robust, and reliable. I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
192842669,1744773429,True,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

192796243,1744722563,True,I like the gunplay which has more realistic velocities and bullet drops.   Every round has it's own unique challenges and allows me to feel like every game is a fresh adventure even if it is the same map.  Alike any other studio there is things they could be doing better.  But the core of this game sets it apart from the rest.

192753925,1744659711,True,"PUBG is a beautiful mess where you drop out of a plane, hit the ground running, and die to a guy with a crowbar who somehow looted a whole town in 12 seconds. The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

Krafton claims to be ""concerned"" about the lack of players on the Oceanic server but continues to show complete and utter disdain for them.<br>Instead of giving me a new anime-type skin that costs $10-$20 real dollars, may I have some bug fixes related to connection and performance issues?

I’ve always aimed to play fairly and respectfully, and I take great pride in maintaining a clean gaming record.  The game in question was one where I performed well, and I understand that sometimes strong performances can raise suspicion. However, I assure you that my gameplay was entirely legitimate.  I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay. I am happy to provide any further information you might need to support this review.  Thank you for your time and for the work you do to keep PUBG fair and enjoyable.

192024922,1743840681,False,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"". Thanks to this, those who play the game badly started playing it frequently. Fix this because I don't enjoy the game. No one who plays the game well enjoys it this way."

Its painful 90 percent of the time but its that 10 percent, where your in an intense gun fight, or landing all your shots or you have a great random group of players who communicate well and help out the team, or you gifted the circle late game and are set up to win. These small moments keep me coming back for more and they truly make the game. There's a lot to dislike but i think there is equally a lot to like as well. It has a steep learning curve, but once you climb that hill, it gets much more enjoyable. Its hands down the only game I'v ever played where at moments,  it has had my heart literally beating out of my chest."

It's so fucking gᾱy now; you'll be watching TV and chatting to people on Discord before you know it. I had to go for 3 long walks in the forest after playing this game ONCE in order to clear the mind viruses from my head. I shudder to think of what this could do to a lower IQ individual with little knowledge of corporate slop electromagnet hypnosis. Stay safe, and never touch this game.

The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots. It got frustrating, and that’s what pushed me away from the game.  10/10 would recommend if the hackers weren’t an issue. It’s a solid game, just needs to fix the cheating problem."

You can Hot drop to one location and have a person pick up a mk12 and aimbot you and your entire squad within 30 seconds. Doesn't happen all the time but squads usually are all hacking when they do.  Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory. If you're serious about fair gameplay this isn't the game for you. If you're not, Go download Epic Games and install a copy there and treat this like GTA 5."

191121971,1742871596,False,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

We do NOT want any more shiny drop box or firework animations but proper optimization."
191699670,1743483485,True,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."
192668572,1744557165,False,"Dear Support Team,  I am contacting you regarding the permanent ban on my PUBG account. I paid €30 for the game, have over 500 hours of playtime, and this is the only game I actively play.  I was banned for allegedly violating the rules, but I have never used any cheats, third-party software, or knowingly broken any rules. If there has been a mistake or my account was flagged in error, I kindly ask you to review the case once more.  If the ban remains in place, I believe I am entitled to a refund, as I have been unfairly excluded from a game I paid for and invested a lot of time into.

Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil. If you play this game as-intended without hacks, you are going to be at a massive disadvantage.    Can fun be had with this game? Yes, but for the sake of your sanity I would recommend you get hooked on another title,.. Unless you can come to terms with getting killed by a hacker in half of your engagements."

192760986,1744667325,False,"The game is pretty filled with Hackers. I came back after a few years and got excited because people are saying there is a ""big skill gap"" for new players. Well, the first match I played, I won. The 2nd after 10 kills I was top 3, 3rd one I won with 14 kills, great. Suddenly, everything started to decline. A total cheat fest, getting snapped through windows, aim bot, wall hack, people targeting me half way through the map, 500-600 meters head shots with a single shot...100% accuracy is insane.    Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers. Pretty appalling state considering the game has been out for 7 years and they ""ban"" 60k hackers a week.    It's depressing."

Please stop putting lipstick on a pig, focusing on cosmetic things that don't matter, and concentrate on the core game again.     I worked in the gaming industry for a long time, and been a gamer much, much longer, and I've never once heard of downtime like this, let alone consistently happening without any new content.

On the other hand I have also felt like a peasant dragged through the slop pits in the medieval times as the crowd shames me through the street for being so god awful at this game.    Game makes you think and that is what matters for an engaging experience of battle royal.  Also the adrenaline rush will kill you in final zone.

I played for 4000 hours and not about to stop. It feels like a competitive, horror survival game. There is an accent on realism which makes it very immersive. The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well. Just be aware: it's HARD, and also you need a pretty good PC, you can play aggressively full squad! ore alone in singel mode ore maybe Duo and be Sanke in the Grass :D"

190630291,1742394869,False,"I mean, this game is objectively terrible.     It's janky  Movements have that low quality underwater vibe going  Gunplay is aggressively mid  Looting is tedious and has too many steps  Character customization is grossly monetized  Sound design is dogshit    There's no way I'll ever recommend this turd to anyone... And yet, every 2 to 3 years, I forget how shitty this game is, I reinstall it, play a few matches, remember how ass it is and uninstall it.

191651599,1743432243,True,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an adrenaline-pumping battle royale experience that truly sets the gold standard for its genre. From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."

If you want yourself to be frustrated by continuous South East hackers and ruin your game, be my guest and play it. Loose your mind over every death you watch on your death cam, your attacker always look at your direction in close proximity. Sound sense is the worst, cant hear anything from enemy running to reload or whatever. I wont recommend playing this. Thoroughly frustrated by hackers."
193067984,1745029629,False,"I've been playing this game since 2018, and I really enjoyed it back then.

I’m probably uninstalling the game soon."
191026374,1742764500,False,"I've been playing PUBG for years, and it used to be one of the best battle royale games out there. However, ever since the game was acquired by Tencent, it has become a disaster.  Cheater Infestation – The anti-cheat system is almost nonexistent. The game is flooded with hackers, especially from regions where cheating is rampant. Reporting does nothing, and Tencent seems to care more about making money than fixing this issue.  Horrible Optimization – The game runs worse than ever. Lag, frame drops, and crashes are a constant problem, even on high-end systems. Instead of fixing performance issues, the developers keep pushing out more skins.  Unbalanced Matchmaking – Skill-based matchmaking is broken, leading to frustratingly unfair matches. You either get paired with complete beginners or ridiculously skilled opponents, making the game unenjoyable.  Lack of Meaningful Updates – Instead of improving core gameplay, Tencent keeps recycling old content and focusing on cosmetics. Other battle royale games have innovated, while PUBG has become stagnant.  Ever since Tencent took over, PUBG has turned into a cheater-filled cash grab. If you're looking for a fair and competitive battle royale experience, look elsewhere."
189858636,1741599644,False,"No.  I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all. But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.  And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).  The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers. Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.  But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game. I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.  Yes the game has some anti cheat measures, but it does not work properly and when a cheater finally gets banned it is mostly temporarily, and they will be back cheating again in a couple of days. Also there is no stopping someone from having multiple accounts."

192260718,1744075139,False,"This game really shows its age. The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."

191338264,1743117876,False,"1. Bullets can hit anyone from almost any distance without a scope. No, it's not your aiming; it's just a game mechanic that favors shooters.  2. Does the zone matter? No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job.

It took me saving and slowing down the footage to truly understand just how bad the game is rigged to make mobile players not want to an hero themselves playing against keyboard and mouse. I urge you to stop supporting things that make your attention the product. The only reason they want your attention is not because they enjoy the thing they create but it is to steal your time and entice you to buy useless pixels on a game that will inevitably die."
188165825,1739849038,False,Worst game ever. More cheaters then any game ever.

You get 2 minutes of looting, then have to run for 10 minutes straight in order to get to the right zone. Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
192842669,1744773429,True,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

Krafton claims to be ""concerned"" about the lack of players on the Oceanic server but continues to show complete and utter disdain for them.<br>Instead of giving me a new anime-type skin that costs $10-$20 real dollars, may I have some bug fixes related to connection and performance issues?

I believe this action may have been taken in error, as I have never used any form of cheating software, nor do I have any knowledge of how to download or use such tools. I’ve always aimed to play fairly and respectfully, and I take great pride in maintaining a clean gaming record.  The game in question was one where I performed well, and I understand that sometimes strong performances can raise suspicion. However, I assure you that my gameplay was entirely legitimate.  I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay. I am happy to provide any further information you might need to support this review.  Thank you for your time and for the work you do to keep PUBG fair and enjoyable.

192024922,1743840681,False,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"". Thanks to this, those who play the game badly started playing it frequently. Fix this because I don't enjoy the game. No one who plays the game well enjoys it this way."

These small moments keep me coming back for more and they truly make the game. There's a lot to dislike but i think there is equally a lot to like as well. It has a steep learning curve, but once you climb that hill, it gets much more enjoyable.

191198725,1742959392,True,"I’ve got over 1,400 hours in PUBG, and I love the thrill of jumping in with nothing, scavenging for gear, and hoping my teammates have microphones. The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots. It got frustrating, and that’s what pushed me away from the game.  10/10 would recommend if the hackers weren’t an issue. It’s a solid game, just needs to fix the cheating problem."

You can Hot drop to one location and have a person pick up a mk12 and aimbot you and your entire squad within 30 seconds. Doesn't happen all the time but squads usually are all hacking when they do.  Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory. If you're serious about fair gameplay this isn't the game for you. If you're not, Go download Epic Games and install a copy there and treat this like GTA 5."

191121971,1742871596,False,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

We do NOT want any more shiny drop box or firework animations but proper optimization."
191699670,1743483485,True,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."

Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil.

Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers.

Please stop putting lipstick on a pig, focusing on cosmetic things that don't matter, and concentrate on the core game again.     I worked in the gaming industry for a long time, and been a gamer much, much longer, and I've never once heard of downtime like this, let alone consistently happening without any new content.

On the other hand I have also felt like a peasant dragged through the slop pits in the medieval times as the crowd shames me through the street for being so god awful at this game.    Game makes you think and that is what matters for an engaging experience of battle royal.  Also the adrenaline rush will kill you in final zone. Had a dude light up a dead body with an MG as I proceeded to throw a grenade over said body for the kill. 10/10 would Pan again.

I played for 4000 hours and not about to stop. It feels like a competitive, horror survival game. There is an accent on realism which makes it very immersive. The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well. Just be aware: it's HARD, and also you need a pretty good PC, you can play aggressively full squad! ore alone in singel mode ore maybe Duo and be Sanke in the Grass :D"

190630291,1742394869,False,"I mean, this game is objectively terrible.     It's janky  Movements have that low quality underwater vibe going  Gunplay is aggressively mid  Looting is tedious and has too many steps  Character customization is grossly monetized  Sound design is dogshit    There's no way I'll ever recommend this turd to anyone... And yet, every 2 to 3 years, I forget how shitty this game is, I reinstall it, play a few matches, remember how ass it is and uninstall it.    You should buy it just so you can play for a bit and go ""Damn, this fucking idiot in the reviews was right"""
191651599,1743432243,True,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an adrenaline-pumping battle royale experience that truly sets the gold standard for its genre. From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."
192800060,1744726434,False,"After launching years ago, I continuously find hackers, aimbotters, wallers, and cheaters in almost every map i join. If you want yourself to be frustrated by continuous South East hackers and ruin your game, be my guest and play it. Loose your mind over every death you watch on your death cam, your attacker always look at your direction in close proximity. Sound sense is the worst, cant hear anything from enemy running to reload or whatever. I wont recommend playing this. Thoroughly frustrated by hackers."
193067984,1745029629,False,"I've been playing this game since 2018, and I really enjoyed it back then. But as time goes on, especially now, the game has just gotten worse — unstable, laggy, tons of input lag, filled with trash battle passes full of pinky stuff and it's getting more and more... gay. I’m probably uninstalling the game soon."
191026374,1742764500,False,"I've been playing PUBG for years, and it used to be one of the best battle royale games out there. However, ever since the game was acquired by Tencent, it has become a disaster.  Cheater Infestation – The anti-cheat system is almost nonexistent. The game is flooded with hackers, especially from regions where cheating is rampant. Reporting does nothing, and Tencent seems to care more about making money than fixing this issue.  Horrible Optimization – The game runs worse than ever. Lag, frame drops, and crashes are a constant problem, even on high-end systems. Instead of fixing performance issues, the developers keep pushing out more skins.  Unbalanced Matchmaking – Skill-based matchmaking is broken, leading to frustratingly unfair matches. You either get paired with complete beginners or ridiculously skilled opponents, making the game unenjoyable.  Lack of Meaningful Updates – Instead of improving core gameplay, Tencent keeps recycling old content and focusing on cosmetics. Other battle royale games have innovated, while PUBG has become stagnant.  Ever since Tencent took over, PUBG has turned into a cheater-filled cash grab. If you're looking for a fair and competitive battle royale experience, look elsewhere."
189858636,1741599644,False,"No.  I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all. But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.  And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).  The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers. Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.  But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game. I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.  Yes the game has some anti cheat measures, but it does not work properly and when a cheater finally gets banned it is mostly temporarily, and they will be back cheating again in a couple of days. Also there is no stopping someone from having multiple accounts."

192410856,1744264581,False,"Lets be real, the movement is hilariously horrible. The Audio is completely misleading and will have you spinning in circles. Not even worth buying the game at a discounted price. As of 2025, I would advise staying away from this game."
193017459,1744981349,False,"Can't select map. Game is flooded with bots. Body armor and helmets are just for show, they don't reduce damage. Small caliber SMGs and HANDGUNS make more damage than bigger caliber assault rifles. ""Skill based matchmaking"" in this game is a joke. Game decides whenever you shot is a hit or not, also determines the damage. If you value your nervous system you'll simply not play this game."
192370907,1744214497,False,"Full of cheater. Every session minimum 3-4 team using map, auto-aim, much life. Wait in zone 7-8 minutes. Much bag capacity more than 10 grenade etc. Reporting but nothing happening very seldom temporary for just 1 day! Almost never permanent ban. It was very good several years ago but now i dont advice to anybody play this game."
192043487,1743859170,False,"Casual is broken because everyone bots, ranking is broken because everyone has a rank 10 times higher. Probably game is dead"
188598460,1740332022,False,Trash game. Full of cheaters. Only reason I play with my friends is because nothing else has come out thats worth while in the last 5 years and this game is consistent. Consistently trash but consistent none the less.
192260718,1744075139,False,"This game really shows its age. The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."

191338264,1743117876,False,"1. Bullets can hit anyone from almost any distance without a scope. No, it's not your aiming; it's just a game mechanic that favors shooters.  2. Does the zone matter? No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job. Congratulations..."

188623087,1740355663,False,supposedly its my ISP but this game is flawed. i have to exit to desktop after each raid then either plug in or unplug my ethernet cable before launching the game again. i've done EVERYTHING i can think of under the sun to fix it but this is my reality so i wouldn't reccomend this game to you if you use Spectrum as your ISP.

If you think that the people who bought this game from the original owners are not using machine learned matchmaking algorithms to keep you ""engaged,"" you are smoking crack. It took me saving and slowing down the footage to truly understand just how bad the game is rigged to make mobile players not want to an hero themselves playing against keyboard and mouse. I urge you to stop supporting things that make your attention the product. The only reason they want your attention is not because they enjoy the thing they create but it is to steal your time and entice you to buy useless pixels on a game that will inevitably die."
188165825,1739849038,False,Worst game ever. More cheaters then any game ever. I think the developers build the cheats and sell them themselves or get a family member to do it and slip them the code changes. Then they pretend to care and claim they ban people. After they made it free to play it got even worse. Don't recommend anyone play this game.

Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
192842669,1744773429,True,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

192796243,1744722563,True,I like the gunplay which has more realistic velocities and bullet drops.   Every round has it's own unique challenges and allows me to feel like every game is a fresh adventure even if it is the same map.  Alike any other studio there is things they could be doing better.

The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

Krafton claims to be ""concerned"" about the lack of players on the Oceanic server but continues to show complete and utter disdain for them.<br>Instead of giving me a new anime-type skin that costs $10-$20 real dollars, may I have some bug fixes related to connection and performance issues?

I’ve always aimed to play fairly and respectfully, and I take great pride in maintaining a clean gaming record.  The game in question was one where I performed well, and I understand that sometimes strong performances can raise suspicion. However, I assure you that my gameplay was entirely legitimate.  I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay. I am happy to provide any further information you might need to support this review.  Thank you for your time and for the work you do to keep PUBG fair and enjoyable.

192024922,1743840681,False,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"". Thanks to this, those who play the game badly started playing it frequently. Fix this because I don't enjoy the game. No one who plays the game well enjoys it this way."

These small moments keep me coming back for more and they truly make the game. There's a lot to dislike but i think there is equally a lot to like as well.

It's so fucking gᾱy now; you'll be watching TV and chatting to people on Discord before you know it. I had to go for 3 long walks in the forest after playing this game ONCE in order to clear the mind viruses from my head.

191433505,1743216193,True,"This game is really fun, I've been playing it for years on and off. It's come a long ways in terms of network code and playability. The gunplay feels way more fair and balanced than Warzone, which makes me want to throw my keyboard out the window."

191198725,1742959392,True,"I’ve got over 1,400 hours in PUBG, and I love the thrill of jumping in with nothing, scavenging for gear, and hoping my teammates have microphones. The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots. It got frustrating, and that’s what pushed me away from the game.  10/10 would recommend if the hackers weren’t an issue. It’s a solid game, just needs to fix the cheating problem."
191197085,1742957074,True,A lot less hackers than COD. Keeping things fresh. Better game experience than other FPS games for myself.
191194188,1742953112,False,"1/10 Because the Devs cannot get a handle on banning and preventing hackers. You can Hot drop to one location and have a person pick up a mk12 and aimbot you and your entire squad within 30 seconds. Doesn't happen all the time but squads usually are all hacking when they do.  Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory. If you're serious about fair gameplay this isn't the game for you. If you're not, Go download Epic Games and install a copy there and treat this like GTA 5."

191121971,1742871596,False,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

We do NOT want any more shiny drop box or firework animations but proper optimization."
191699670,1743483485,True,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."
192668572,1744557165,False,"Dear Support Team,  I am contacting you regarding the permanent ban on my PUBG account. I paid €30 for the game, have over 500 hours of playtime, and this is the only game I actively play.  I was banned for allegedly violating the rules, but I have never used any cheats, third-party software, or knowingly broken any rules. If there has been a mistake or my account was flagged in error, I kindly ask you to review the case once more.  If the ban remains in place, I believe I am entitled to a refund, as I have been unfairly excluded from a game I paid for and invested a lot of time into.

Weekly, the developer posts that they ban 10% of it's player base because they are detected as cheaters. Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil. If you play this game as-intended without hacks, you are going to be at a massive disadvantage.    Can fun be had with this game? Yes, but for the sake of your sanity I would recommend you get hooked on another title,.. Unless you can come to terms with getting killed by a hacker in half of your engagements."

192760986,1744667325,False,"The game is pretty filled with Hackers. I came back after a few years and got excited because people are saying there is a ""big skill gap"" for new players. Well, the first match I played, I won. The 2nd after 10 kills I was top 3, 3rd one I won with 14 kills, great. Suddenly, everything started to decline. A total cheat fest, getting snapped through windows, aim bot, wall hack, people targeting me half way through the map, 500-600 meters head shots with a single shot...100% accuracy is insane.    Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers. Pretty appalling state considering the game has been out for 7 years and they ""ban"" 60k hackers a week.    It's depressing."

On the other hand I have also felt like a peasant dragged through the slop pits in the medieval times as the crowd shames me through the street for being so god awful at this game.

The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well. Just be aware: it's HARD, and also you need a pretty good PC, you can play aggressively full squad! ore alone in singel mode ore maybe Duo and be Sanke in the Grass :D"

190630291,1742394869,False,"I mean, this game is objectively terrible.     It's janky  Movements have that low quality underwater vibe going  Gunplay is aggressively mid  Looting is tedious and has too many steps  Character customization is grossly monetized  Sound design is dogshit    There's no way I'll ever recommend this turd to anyone... And yet, every 2 to 3 years, I forget how shitty this game is, I reinstall it, play a few matches, remember how ass it is and uninstall it.    You should buy it just so you can play for a bit and go ""Damn, this fucking idiot in the reviews was right"""
191651599,1743432243,True,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an adrenaline-pumping battle royale experience that truly sets the gold standard for its genre. From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."
192800060,1744726434,False,"After launching years ago, I continuously find hackers, aimbotters, wallers, and cheaters in almost every map i join. If you want yourself to be frustrated by continuous South East hackers and ruin your game, be my guest and play it. Loose your mind over every death you watch on your death cam, your attacker always look at your direction in close proximity. Sound sense is the worst, cant hear anything from enemy running to reload or whatever. I wont recommend playing this. Thoroughly frustrated by hackers."
193067984,1745029629,False,"I've been playing this game since 2018, and I really enjoyed it back then. But as time goes on, especially now, the game has just gotten worse — unstable, laggy, tons of input lag, filled with trash battle passes full of pinky stuff and it's getting more and more... gay. I’m probably uninstalling the game soon."
191026374,1742764500,False,"I've been playing PUBG for years, and it used to be one of the best battle royale games out there. However, ever since the game was acquired by Tencent, it has become a disaster.  Cheater Infestation – The anti-cheat system is almost nonexistent. The game is flooded with hackers, especially from regions where cheating is rampant. Reporting does nothing, and Tencent seems to care more about making money than fixing this issue.  Horrible Optimization – The game runs worse than ever. Lag, frame drops, and crashes are a constant problem, even on high-end systems. Instead of fixing performance issues, the developers keep pushing out more skins.  Unbalanced Matchmaking – Skill-based matchmaking is broken, leading to frustratingly unfair matches. You either get paired with complete beginners or ridiculously skilled opponents, making the game unenjoyable.  Lack of Meaningful Updates – Instead of improving core gameplay, Tencent keeps recycling old content and focusing on cosmetics. Other battle royale games have innovated, while PUBG has become stagnant.  Ever since Tencent took over, PUBG has turned into a cheater-filled cash grab. If you're looking for a fair and competitive battle royale experience, look elsewhere."
189858636,1741599644,False,"No.  I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all. But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.  And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).  The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers. Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.  But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game. I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.  Yes the game has some anti cheat measures, but it does not work properly and when a cheater finally gets banned it is mostly temporarily, and they will be back cheating again in a couple of days. Also there is no stopping someone from having multiple accounts."

192260718,1744075139,False,"This game really shows its age. The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."

191338264,1743117876,False,"1. Bullets can hit anyone from almost any distance without a scope. No, it's not your aiming; it's just a game mechanic that favors shooters.  2. Does the zone matter? No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job. Congratulations..."

188623087,1740355663,False,supposedly its my ISP but this game is flawed. i have to exit to desktop after each raid then either plug in or unplug my ethernet cable before launching the game again. i've done EVERYTHING i can think of under the sun to fix it but this is my reality so i wouldn't reccomend this game to you if you use Spectrum as your ISP.

If you think that the people who bought this game from the original owners are not using machine learned matchmaking algorithms to keep you ""engaged,"" you are smoking crack. It took me saving and slowing down the footage to truly understand just how bad the game is rigged to make mobile players not want to an hero themselves playing against keyboard and mouse. I urge you to stop supporting things that make your attention the product. The only reason they want your attention is not because they enjoy the thing they create but it is to steal your time and entice you to buy useless pixels on a game that will inevitably die."
188165825,1739849038,False,Worst game ever. More cheaters then any game ever. I think the developers build the cheats and sell them themselves or get a family member to do it and slip them the code changes. Then they pretend to care and claim they ban people. After they made it free to play it got even worse. Don't recommend anyone play this game.

You get 2 minutes of looting, then have to run for 10 minutes straight in order to get to the right zone. Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

192844633,1744776470,True,"Oof, I need to write a review after saying I would recommend? Okay, I guess I'll share a little : ) .    This game is fun, solid, robust, and reliable. I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
192842669,1744773429,True,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

192796243,1744722563,True,I like the gunplay which has more realistic velocities and bullet drops.   Every round has it's own unique challenges and allows me to feel like every game is a fresh adventure even if it is the same map.  Alike any other studio there is things they could be doing better.

The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay.

192024922,1743840681,False,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"".

The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots. It got frustrating, and that’s what pushed me away from the game.  10/10 would recommend if the hackers weren’t an issue. It’s a solid game, just needs to fix the cheating problem."

Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory.

191121971,1742871596,False,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

We do NOT want any more shiny drop box or firework animations but proper optimization."
191699670,1743483485,True,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."

I still do, but we need to talk about the elephant in the room: This game has been ruined by a gigantic cheating problem and the developers aren't combating the problem good enough. Weekly, the developer posts that they ban 10% of it's player base because they are detected as cheaters. Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil. If you play this game as-intended without hacks, you are going to be at a massive disadvantage.    Can fun be had with this game? Yes, but for the sake of your sanity I would recommend you get hooked on another title,.. Unless you can come to terms with getting killed by a hacker in half of your engagements."

A total cheat fest, getting snapped through windows, aim bot, wall hack, people targeting me half way through the map, 500-600 meters head shots with a single shot...100% accuracy is insane.    Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers.
