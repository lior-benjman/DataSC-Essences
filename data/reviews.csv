730,193454532,1745467339,0,18992,0.476190477609634399,"This game is unique in the sense that there isn't another competitive experience that matches Counter Strike 2. Which is what makes it both one of the best and worst games I've ever played, rounds never play the same as the last, being that the strategies, weapons, and tools you use change every round to adapt to the situation at hand to win a round and keep a lead in a match larger, or trying to win enough rounds to tie up a match in an otherwise unwinnable scenario. This amplifies a win grasped from the jaws of defeat feel so satisfying, but on the other hand, makes a loss when victory seemed almost guaranteed feel devastating.   While this game is fun, it's hard to ignore certain issues after an extended amount of playtime, one reason is that this game isn't easy to learn and even harder to master, which can lead a new player into falsely jumping in head first, without proper knowledge, to be stomped in competitive where most of the game is centered around. This is largely in part to the very basic and lacking in game ""tutorial"", which doesn't explain enough for new players to genuinely understand the proper way to play a real competitive match and can more often then not lead them to be kicked without actually learning anything in the process.   Another issue I've had with the game is just how bad the VAC system is, even after the 3.0 updates, which didn't work on launch and was extremely touchy, giving me two 7 day global cooldowns back to back through no fault of my own. Even after the VAC system was refined I've still ran into cheaters fairly often after, this also leads into a much larger issue with the game overall, that being the genuinely poor update rate and support the game itself gets, which means barely any new maps to play while the very few maps in rotation for competitve modes are taken away at random and for long periods of time, sparse patches, very few rebalances and changes to general gameplay on a global level, but at the same time making sure that there are always new case sets and armory passes, which themselves have long periods of not changing at all, even when a rotation is needed or should be done.  Overall, a fun-ish game to play when queuing with friends provided you know how to play, solo queue can be okay, but often won't be that much fun due to bad teamates, both in terms of play and sportsmanship, and enemy teams who can sometimes seem as if they just came out of a pro league or are just plain cheating."

If you are looking for a technical shooter with a high skill ceiling or you're just a gambler, I would recommend that you at least give it a try."

730,193438887,1745444890,1,9228,0.5,"✅ Recommended  Hours Played: Lost count lol  Counter-Strike 2 is like meeting your childhood friend after years — they glow up, talk smoother, and still one-tap you in a corner with a Deagle.  🎮 Pros:  Smokes are now magical mist creatures that move when you breathe on them.  Peekers advantage still makes me question physics, but in 144Hz it’s spiritual.  Graphics so sharp, I mistook Dust2 for a desert vacation spot.  😩 Cons:  Ranked makes me question my life choices every 3 games.  Cheaters? Less now, but still lurking like CTs in a smoke.  Valve, let me queue Inferno only. I’m begging.  💬 Final Thoughts: CS2 isn’t perfect, but it’s home. Whether you're whiffing in Silver or dropping 40 bombs in Premier, the addiction stays the same.  10/10 — Lost sleep, gained aim.  🕹️ “Buy armor. Rush B. Regret nothing.”"

730,193436186,1745441871,1,27825,0.5,"Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is like the evolution of a beautifully toxic relationship with gaming. It’s faster, shinier, and somehow even more rage-inducing than the original. I thought I was prepared for this—I wasn’t. Here’s the thing: You’re either winning with style or getting clutched on by a 12-year-old who’s already better than you.  Now, let’s talk about the Russians. They’re the soul of CS2. You think you’re playing a competitive shooter, but really you’re playing “Guess Who’s Gonna Yell At You For The Next 45 Minutes?” Spoiler: It’s always the Russians. You’ll hear “Rush B, no stop!” with the passion of a thousand vodka shots, followed by a perfectly timed, “Na, na, na, na, na…” as they solo the entire enemy team with a P90 and no fear. Forget tactics; this is just raw, chaotic energy, and it’s glorious."

730,193401916,1745406663,1,41370,0.5,"Review: Counter-Strike 2 – A Refined Evolution of a Classic  Counter-Strike 2 marks a new era for one of the most iconic first-person shooter franchises in gaming history. Building upon the rock-solid foundation of CS:GO, CS2 elevates the experience with the power of the Source 2 engine, bringing modern visuals, improved performance, and a suite of new features that enhance both casual and competitive play.  Visual Overhaul The first thing you notice in CS2 is the dramatic visual upgrade. Maps like Dust II and Mirage have been reimagined with more realistic lighting, cleaner textures, and improved geometry—while still retaining the iconic layouts players know and love. Smoke grenades now interact dynamically with the environment, bullets, and light, creating new tactical layers that feel fresh without breaking the core gameplay loop.  Gameplay That Respects Its Roots The gameplay remains as sharp and skill-based as ever. CS2 doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel—it refines it. Movement feels smoother, hit registration is more consistent, and the netcode improvements are a blessing for competitive matches. For longtime fans, it's like slipping back into your favorite pair of sneakers—just more comfortable and better looking.  Matchmaking & Community Tools Valve has taken strides to modernize matchmaking and community integration. Competitive players will appreciate the upgraded ranking system and cleaner UI, while newcomers will find onboarding slightly more accessible than in previous iterations. Workshop support and community servers continue to thrive, giving CS2 the same grassroots energy that helped CS:GO flourish.  Final Thoughts CS2 is a masterclass in how to evolve a legendary title without losing what made it great. It’s faster, prettier, and more polished—but still offers the same adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes gameplay that has captivated players for over two decades. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a curious newcomer, Counter-Strike 2 is well worth your time.  Rating: 9.5/10 A beautiful blend of nostalgia and innovation—Counter-Strike has never felt better."

730,193390172,1745387435,1,8326,0.5,"One serious issue - Please Address New player experience is awful, if you want to have success getting new players to stay longer than one game, please consider the following; Reduce XP CAP - I have over 120 hours and still cannot play Prem, I am forced to play against 3000 hour players who are still silver on comp due to only playing prem or faceit. Matchmaking - Matchmaking is being ruined due to the reason above, I will have a team mate losing their mind at their 20 hour team mate who cannot throw a flashbang without blinding their team, it is bad for both new players and veterans, carry over elo from prem to regular comp please.  The poor match making also has a flow on effect, lots of low hour players instantly calling cheats or wallhacks because a player with 1000 hours prefires the worlds most common angle to hold, to any sane player this is easy to do, to a new player, swinging angles, crosshair placement and prefires are just hacking.  Besides that the game is awesome, only reason i'm sticking around is because I love a game with few chances for ""randomness"" and pure repeatable skill, high skill ceiling where you do not feel like something was just unfair."

730,193385129,1745379731,1,17757,0.5,"Okay, I have over 300 hours in CS:GO. And somehow, despite all the blood, sweat, and keyboard rage I’ve poured into this game, I’m still here—writing a review about how much I absolutely despise it. But… I love it. I really do. CS:GO is like the toxic ex you can’t quit—every time you swear it off, it pulls you back in with a clutch play or a smooth headshot that makes you think, “Maybe I’m actually good at this.” Spoiler: I’m not. The community? Oh, it’s a beautiful dumpster fire. It's like walking into a room full of people who think they’re the next esports prodigy while you’re just over here trying to figure out how to properly throw a flashbang without blinding yourself. It’s a chaotic mess where everyone is a god, and I am the unfortunate 13-year-old with a voice crack trying to explain why I didn’t buy armor because I just had enough money for a deagle. “BUY A DEFUSER!” they yell, even though I was the one who defused the bomb last round, you ungrateful pixel warrior. The language in this game? Oh boy. It's like a master class in toxic masculinity and insecurity. I’ve never heard so many grown men act like their whole identity hinges on being the best at a 10-year-old game. It’s always the same—guys who are so insecure about their skill who’ve convinced themselves that yelling at random strangers online will somehow make them feel better about their lives. Somehow, I keep coming back. I guess I’m addicted to the pain. The matchmaking system? More like ""matchmaking mystery."" Every time I join a game, I’m greeted by a mix of 12-year-olds who think they’re in Call of Duty and people who are just aggressively shouting in their mics. ""I’m a pro"" says one guy with a 1-8 K/D. Alright, buddy, sure. You know what though? I love it. There’s something about CS:GO that keeps me coming back. Sure, I’ve had my heart broken by the game more times than I can count (many, many, many opened cases with nothing but blue skins of despair), but every time I hear the sweet sound of the bomb ticking down, or the satisfying clink of a headshot, I remember why I keep playing. Would I recommend this game to anyone? Well, yes, but only if you’re ready to experience frustration, confusion, and an unhealthy dependency on substances. CS:GO is like that abusive relationship that always promises it’ll get better, but deep down, we all know the truth: it won’t.  But hey, I’ll still be playing tomorrow.  1/10, but like, a 10/10 for masochism.  Also Valve, your anti-cheat system is like a fire extinguisher that only works when there’s no fire. It bans me for breathing too loudly, but hackers are out here flying around the map like it’s GTA. Maybe it's time for VAC to actually start working instead of just pretending it's on the job while hackers run wild."

730,193374294,1745365570,0,4041,0.5,"Multiplayer: Still Got Some Spark Counter-Strike (CS:GO or CS2) is one of those games you either like or totally get hooked on. The multiplayer is a gem: precise shooting, team strategies, and managing cash for weapons make every match engaging. Maps like Dust II and Mirage are designed for competition, keeping you on your toes. With CS2’s Source 2 engine, visuals and animations feel smoother and more modern. On paper, it’s a killer formula. Community: A Hellhole of Cheats and Toxicity But here’s the harsh truth: Counter-Strike’s community is an absolute trainwreck. It’s crawling with cheaters using blatant hacks like wallhacks and aimbots, ruining any fun. Matchmaking is a mess—either you’re stuck with cheaters or teammates who play like they’ve never touched a mouse. Worse, a bunch of shady players with toxic behavior and scams have dragged the game’s name through the mud. Sure, not everyone’s awful, but these rotten apples have made Counter-Strike infamous for all the wrong reasons. Valve seems asleep at the wheel; their anti-cheat system is a joke, and these issues have been festering for years. Verdict Counter-Strike has a gripping multiplayer, but its toxic community and rampant cheaters turn it into a nerve-wracking slog. With things this bad, I can’t recommend it to anyone. If you’ve got nerves of steel, you might enjoy a few hours, but you’ll likely get fed up with the cheats and toxicity fast. Score: 5/10"

Despite these issues, the core gameplay is still enjoyable, and I really hope a proper anti-cheat system is implemented soon."

Even with that said I enjoy it fundamentally and the community is actually pretty fun most of the time.  To be fair as well, I am pushing 50 and it's the only shooter my friends will play with me so I guess I recommend it."

There is no Quake, Tribes, etc in the modern age with as active of a casual playerbase as CS2. You can still jump in and play Dust2 any time of day or night, and I would give anything to be able to do that for Unreal Tournament or Tribes. For this reason alone, I give CS2 a thumbs up, but is basically a money laundering skin mall filled with giga sketchy people and cheaters."

А ты мне опять со своим вот этим, иди суетись дальше, это твоё распределение, это твой путь и твой горизонт познания и ощущения твоей природы, он несоизмеримо мелок по сравнению с моим, понимаешь? Я как будто бы уже давно глубокий старец, бессмертный, ну или там уже почти бессмертный, который на этой планете от её самого зарождения, ещё когда только Солнце только-только сформировалось как звезда, и вот это газопылевое облако, вот, после взрыва, Солнца, когда оно вспыхнуло, как звезда, начало формировать вот эти коацерваты, планеты, понимаешь, я на этой Земле уже как будто почти пять миллиардов лет живу и знаю её вдоль и поперёк этот весь мир, а ты мне какие-то... мне не важно на твои тачки, на твои яхты, на твои квартиры, там, на твоё благо. Я был на этой планете бесконечным множеством, и круче Цезаря, и круче Гитлера, и круче всех великих, понимаешь, был, а где-то был конченым говном, ещё хуже, чем здесь. Я множество этих состояний чувствую. Где-то я был больше подобен растению, где-то я больше был подобен птице, там, червю, где-то был просто сгусток камня, это всё есть душа, понимаешь? Она имеет грани подобия совершенно многообразные, бесконечное множество. Но тебе этого не понять, поэтому ты езжай себе , мы в этом мире как бы живем разными ощущениями и разными стремлениями, соответственно, разное наше и место, разное и наше распределение. Тебе я желаю все самые крутые тачки чтоб были у тебя, и все самые лучше самки, если мало идей, обращайся ко мне, я тебе на каждую твою идею предложу сотню триллионов, как всё делать. Ну а я всё, я иду как глубокий старец,узревший вечное, прикоснувшийся к Божественному, сам стал богоподобен и устремлен в это бесконечное, и который в умиротворении, покое, гармонии, благодати, в этом сокровенном блаженстве пребывает, вовлеченный во всё и во вся, понимаешь, вот и всё, в этом наша разница. Так что я иду любоваться мирозданием, а ты идёшь преисполняться в ГРАНЯХ каких-то, вот и вся разница, понимаешь, ты не зришь это вечное бесконечное, оно тебе не нужно. Ну зато ты, так сказать, более активен, как вот этот дятел долбящий, или муравей, который очень активен в своей стезе, поэтому давай, наши пути здесь, конечно, имеют грани подобия, потому что всё едино, но я-то тебя прекрасно понимаю, а вот ты меня - вряд ли, потому что я как бы тебя в себе содержу, всю твою природу, она составляет одну маленькую там песчинку, от того что есть во мне, вот и всё, поэтому давай, ступай, езжай, а я пошел наслаждаться прекрасным осенним закатом на берегу теплой южной реки. Всё, ступай, и я пойду."

With its iconic bomb defusal and hostage rescue modes, the game offers tight gameplay mechanics and a high skill ceiling. While the learning curve can be steep for newcomers, the thrill of clutch plays and tactical wins makes it incredibly rewarding. The skin market and esports scene add depth and longevity, though occasional issues with matchmaking and cheaters can be frustrating."

So I can load into CS2 and experience input lag, broken hitboxes, and visuals that somehow manage to blind me and tank my FPS at the same time?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The UI? Fortnite cosplay. The new loadout system? Useless. The VAC system? Might as well be called ""VACation"" for how often it takes a break.  I’ve invested money, time, and emotional well-being into this franchise. And CS2 rewards that loyalty with disappointment, a UI that belongs in a mobile game, Valve, if you're reading this — I want my money back, and maybe also an apology. Actually, I want Gabe Newell to look me in the eyes and explain why I can't strafe properly anymore."

It has been my go-to first person shooter this past year, my remedy against the current video game landscape overflowing with over-saturated games full of pay-to-win mechanics and advertisements for DLCs.    THANK YOU Minh Le for making this game, to Valve for the continuous work at improving the game and adding minimal but gameplay enhancing changes when necessary and to the CS community for the beautiful  maps and weapons skins."

730,193253936,1745229646,1,88611,0.523809552192687988,"Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is an exciting evolution of the beloved first-person shooter franchise. Building on the solid foundation of its predecessor, CS:GO, CS2 offers improved graphics, smoother gameplay, and new features that enhance the overall experience.  One of the most noticeable upgrades is the stunning visual overhaul. The game now features more detailed environments and realistic effects, making each match more immersive. The gameplay remains true to the classic Counter-Strike style—fast-paced, strategic, and skill-based—yet the updates add a fresh feel that keeps it exciting for both new and veteran players.  The matchmaking system has been refined for better balance and quicker queue times, which is great for players eager to jump into action. Additionally, the weapon handling and movement feel more responsive, giving players a greater sense of control and precision.  Community features and customization options have also been expanded, allowing players to personalize their experience and connect more easily with others. The game’s sound design continues to be top-notch, providing crucial audio cues that can make the difference between victory and defeat.  Overall, CS2 successfully modernizes a classic while respecting its roots. It’s a must-try for fans of competitive shooters and anyone looking for a fast, tactical multiplayer experience. While it retains the core gameplay that made CS popular, the new visuals and improvements make it feel fresh and engaging.  In summary, Counter-Strike 2 is a fantastic update that offers both nostalgia and innovation. It’s definitely worth checking out!"

730,193223302,1745188206,0,27483,0.5,"former source & csgo player, never that high in comp rankings but a fairly decent shooter when matchmaking was balanced and definitely more of an entry frag style player. there's something about this iteration which just feels off, and I can't quite put my finger on it. I get rubberbanding pretty often which obviously isn't good for a competitive game, something I don't remember ever happening in csgo other than the occasional spurts of server lag which everyone experienced at the same time. I'll edit this review if it gets fixed.   the game feels like it should be really good, I'm just not enjoying it. It's a polished version of csgo in nearly every way. I don't know if it's because I've just gotten too bored of games these days, but it feels like the player base have all started injecting estrogen. there's no real laughter or hazing, people on casual are all really sweaty and have the shift key taped down and everyone's just taking it too seriously. they did in csgo to a lesser degree but it was always in good spirit. either I'm too old now or this iteration is just the next step towards being fully e-sports oriented?   that would be fair enough, and I'll keep playing every so often because of nostalgia and also to test myself, but my idea of a game is to have fun and for that reason I wouldn't recommend to new players. if you're just looking for fun, go find another game."

An insanely worse competitive system and experience in general. Shit hit reg. Wouldn't recommend for people old or new to the series. And seeing the 2000 hours I put in CSGO show up when I play this game just pisses me off. Thanks Valve. This game shows that even if you did do a Half-Life 3 you would just fuck it up like this trash can game.

The server connection in Southeast Asia is decent, but sometimes there's a bit of lag. Still, the gameplay is super intense and competitive, which I love. The anticheat is weak and sometimes you can encounter cheaters. It’s great to see how Valve is improving the game — I’m excited to see more updates in the future!"

730,193219117,1745184015,1,4580,0.5,"What I love about Counter-Strike 2 is how it manages to feel both fresh and familiar at the same time. From the first round, you can tell Valve really poured love into this upgrade. The new engine makes everything look so clean and crisp—maps I’ve played a hundred times now feel brand new, with lighting and detail that actually affect how I play.    But it’s not just about the looks. The gunplay is tighter than ever. Every shot feels responsive, every peek feels smoother, and when you land that perfect headshot... man, it's still the most satisfying feeling in any shooter. The dynamic smoke grenades blew my mind the first time I saw them react to gunfire or a HE grenade. It actually adds new layers of strategy and timing that weren’t there before.    I also love how streamlined the UI and matchmaking have become. It's faster to get into games, easier to track your rank and progress, and overall just feels more modern. Whether I’m sweating in comp, vibing in casuals, or messing around with friends on custom maps, CS2 keeps me coming back.    At its core, CS2 is everything I’ve always loved about CS—but polished, updated, and ready for the next era. It’s competitive, it’s intense, and it’s just plain addicting."

Let me just say this up front: this game slaps harder than a Molotov cocktail at a pool party.    CS2 takes the soul of CS:GO, feeds it protein powder, dunks it in an HDR oil bath, and then throws it into a server where a 12-year-old from Norway snipes you through a smoke while quoting Sun Tzu in the chat. The tick rate has been upgraded and feels smoother than a jazz solo played by a caffeinated ferret. Peeking now feels like a moral decision. Sometimes I peek and think, “This is it, this is how I die,” and it’s beautiful.    The graphics are so crisp I accidentally tried to pet a smoke grenade thinking it was a real dog. The lighting effects make Dust2 look like it was designed by Christopher Nolan. And let’s talk about the new volumetric smokes—because holy frag grenade, they change the game. You can now shoot through them, and the bullets part the smoke like Moses parting the Red Sea, except instead of freeing people, you just shot someone named xX420N00bXx in the face.    Weapons still feel like they were handcrafted by angry dwarves in a competitive forge. Every AK spray pattern is a test of memory, muscle, and faith. The AWP still costs as much as rent in a major city but delivers the kind of dopamine hit that should probably be illegal in at least three countries.    But here's the weirdest part: the chickens. I swear there are more chickens, and they’re watching. I was defusing a bomb and three chickens walked up to me and just stared. No clucking. Just silence. They know something.    In conclusion, Counter-Strike 2 is the video game equivalent of yelling “LET’S GOOOO” in your room at 2AM after clutching a 1v4 while wearing a virtual balaclava. It’s sweaty. It’s sharp. It’s pure. If you liked CS:GO, this is your new religion. If you’ve never played before, buckle up. The terrorists may win, but so do you.    9.5/10 — would flashbang myself again."

730,193197886,1745165605,1,9936,0.5,"""This game will make you want to eat a brick—raw.""  The anti-cheat is so bad it might as well be a fan cheering on the hackers. CS2 doesn’t just introduce you to competitive shooters—it welcomes you into the glamorous world of hardcore gambling addiction with skins shinier than your future.  And yet... you restart the game. Why? Because after 14 soul-crushing rounds of getting turned into digital Swiss cheese, you finally land one single, glorious kill. In that moment, you're not a bottom-fragger—you’re the chosen one.  Sure, the enemy team is doing synchronized Olympic 360s and headshotting you before your ping can say “hello,” but that one kill? That’s dopamine, baby. Injected straight into the veins.  10/10. Would cry again."

730,193150358,1745113922,0,1039,0.5,"[h1]The Same Game That Released in 2012[/h1]  CS:GO 2 is truly the Overwatch 2 of Valve. If you played CS:GO in 2012 then you played CS:GO 2 in 2025 and beyond. Literally Patrick Star logic ""What if we released the same game but put a 2 at the end of it!""  The only difference I can spot is the download size which is absurd since it does NOT look any better than it did in 2012. 60 gb for what??? Other than the size inflating larger than a furry oc with a growth fetish, it's the same exact outdated game. The same game that sweats have been playing since 2012 who love it because they figured out the ""strategy"". The same game with a phobia of aiming down any sight that isn't a scope. If you like Fallout 3 aiming then you will love CS:GO aiming. Nothing has changed and it's just as outdated and predatory as it was back then. A product of the early 2000s no sprint, no ads and insane recoil. Every match boils down to: early rounds, who can stop/crouch the fastest. And later rounds, who can line the sniper scope on the other guys body the fastest. Oh and don't worry. The absolutely bonkers skin black market still exists. But who cares because the only people who would spend $2.5k on a digital knife that you would never use in a 13 year old game is about as intelligent as an EA executive.    [h2]Conclusion[/h2]  CS:GO 2 is the same sh*tty game it was back then just fatter. Marginally fun to play with a full squad of friends but not much else. I couldn't imagine solo queing or playing this game longer than an hour. If you liked original CS:GO then you'll like CS:GO 2 because nothings changed. But if you took a break off CS:GO and are wondering if 2 is worth checking out then pass because it's not."

So it's either my team getting obliterated without me able to do anything about it, or enemy team being absolutely destroyed while 3/5 of our players cant get a single frag in a round. I can't say if there is anything competitive about the ""competitive"".  • There is no pay to win, but seeing all these skins, stickers and graffiti (which look absolutely damn horrible) either in promos or in game is disgusting. Nothing breaks the vibe as much as these rainbow colored skins and bright cartoonish agents.  Oh, and by the way - where are all the map-related T and CT models from CS:GO?  • Not as much maps as I thought there would be. Even CSS had more official maps than this.

730,193138374,1745101173,1,17683,0.5,"After playing for almost 2.500+ hours with multiple accounts, i think it's safe to say that this game is just for surfing or fun servers. The creators or admins do not care about servers or competitive matches. My last 4 out of 5 matches were crawling with cheaters and i'm not just being salty or toxic. They're laughing and openly cheating and don't give a damn about their actions. They play with %100 headshot ratio and i'm writing ""you know this can easily detected by even a bot right?"" and they say ""nope, we're playing like this for almost 4 weeks and no one notice :D"". So basicly just for ""fun"" purposes, yeah this game can playable. But if you really want to play competitive, either play different game like valorant or rainbow 6 siege, or use face it or some other platform. I repeat ""DO NOT USE THEIR OWN MATCHMAKING SYSTEM BECAUSE VALVE IS HIRING PLAIN DUMBS OR BLIND PEOPLE TO WATCH COMPETITIVE MATCHES"". Thank you for reading."

730,193130738,1745094170,1,5676,0.523809552192687988,"Counter-Strike 2 is an incredibly engaging and competitive game that truly captures the spirit of tactical shooters. The thrill of outsmarting your opponents, working as a team, and improving your skills is what keeps you coming back for more. It’s a game that pulls you in and makes you want to push your limits — and for that, it absolutely deserves a recommendation. However, it’s not without its frustrations. One of the biggest issues is the presence of cheaters. The VAC anti-cheat system doesn’t seem to be keeping up, and that seriously affects the experience. Facing obvious hackers ruins the competitive vibe and turns matches into a mess. Another challenge is the community. If you value your peace of mind, you might want to think twice before jumping in — or consider more relaxing games like Minecraft or Farm Frenzy. Toxic players, constant pressure, and rage-inducing rounds are pretty much guaranteed. This isn’t a casual shooter — it’s a mental battlefield. The shooting mechanics have also changed significantly compared to CS:GO. The way bullets register, especially headshots, feels inconsistent and sometimes downright strange. Veteran players will need time to adapt. In conclusion, I do recommend CS2 for its intensity, excitement, and deep competitive gameplay. But be ready — this game will test not only your aim but also your patience. It’s a wild ride, and definitely not for the faint of heart."

It’s an addiction, an obsession, and a battlefield where milliseconds decide legends.    Valve has taken everything we love about CS:GO and turned the dials to 11. Cleaner, crisper graphics. Lightning-fast servers. Sub-tick responsiveness so tight it feels like your thoughts are hitting headshots before your mouse moves. Every round feels like a cinematic experience — every clutch is a heartbeat away from glory or heartbreak.    The gunplay? Still the best in the world. Nothing hits like a crisp AK one-tap or an AWP flick that echoes into eternity. And now, with upgraded smokes that are volumetric and dynamic (yes, they react to nades and bullets), even utility usage is its own mind game.    Tired of rinse-and-repeat shooters with bloated mechanics? CS2 strips it down to pure, refined tactical skill. You outsmart, outshoot, and outlast. It's not just about reactions — it’s about discipline, strategy, and ice in your veins.    Whether you’re a silver trying to climb or a seasoned veteran chasing 5-stack glory, CS2 rewards dedication like no other.    💣 The tension of a 1v4 clutch. 💥 The rush of breaking onto site with milliseconds to plant. 🔥 The symphony of utility, aim, and team comms in perfect harmony.    This game doesn’t hold your hand — it raises your standards.    CS2 isn’t just worth playing. It’s worth mastering.    👏 Download it. Queue up. And welcome to the proving grounds."

Every game feels like a lottery: will I face an actual team or a full stack of ESP-enjoyers? Spoiler: It’s always the ESP guys.  📉 Sub-tick system? On paper: revolutionary. In reality: works great if you're a time-traveler with 0ms ping and a LAN server in your basement. For the rest of us? Hitreg roulette.  💣 Competitive mode? Imagine CS:GO's ranked — but worse. Unbalanced teams, broken ranks, and the occasional lobby of future Twitch bans. Love it.  🎨 Sure, the graphics are great. Smokes are real. Guns look crispy. But… maybe focus on gameplay before photorealistic chicken feathers?  🧠 Simple solution: 💡 Just give us 120 tick + sub-tick (why not both?). 💡 And please, cut down those thousands of spaghetti-code servers. It’s not a buffet — just give us a few servers that actually work!  💀 CS:GO was better. It was like an old hoodie — worn out but warm and reliable.  🤷‍♂️ But hey… Nothing to do. This is the future. Guess we all just gotta keep playing and cope. See you in Inferno. Hopefully not with 80ms."

Valve has taken the classic tactical gameplay we all know and love and polished it to a shine with stunning Source 2 engine visuals, improved responsiveness, and smoother mechanics.  The updated graphics bring a fresh look to familiar maps without compromising the competitive integrity that makes CS special. Smokes are now dynamic and interact with the environment, adding a whole new layer of strategy. Movement feels tighter, shooting feels more responsive, and the matchmaking system has seen noticeable improvements.  What really stands out is how Valve managed to modernize the game without losing the soul of CS:GO. It still feels like Counter-Strike – just sharper, smarter, and more immersive.  Whether you're a veteran or a newcomer, CS2 offers an intense, rewarding, and endlessly replayable experience. It’s not just a game – it's the competitive shooter. 10/10."

The movement system has been reworked from the ground up.  Recoil system has been reworked from the ground up.  The cheating issue you hear people talking about isn't an exaggeration. Even with Prime 9/10 games will have atleast 1 cheater. The ratio is about 1/10 players is a cheater. You do the math.     This game also disincentivizes you reporting people by lowering your ""trust factor"" when you report people. Meaning the more you report people. The worse teammates you get matched up with a similar low ""trust factor""    Valve thinks AI-assisted Overwatch system will fix the cheating issue when they rarely even address reports.     I've probably seen 2 or 3 cheaters banned in my 185 hours. When i've met probably 80-100. Reported about as much as well.     Honestly like unbiased perspective devils advocate this game isn't worth the price tag at it's current state.  I'm willing to accept an invasive anti-cheat system like Valorant uses if it means CS:2 is even 50% as good as CS:GO. This game actually hurts my feelings how far it's fallen from grace."

730,193027181,1744989744,1,48058,0.5,"From the moment I stepped into the revamped world of Counter-Strike 2, I knew I was experiencing something truly special. This isn't just an update; it's a complete reimagining of the tactical shooter that has defined a genre for decades. Counter-Strike 2 takes everything that made its predecessor great and elevates it to an entirely new level of excellence.  The first thing that strikes you is the visual overhaul. The Source 2 engine breathes new life into iconic maps, rendering them in stunning detail. Every texture, every lighting effect, is meticulously crafted, creating an immersive and visually breathtaking experience. But this isn't just about aesthetics; the improved graphics enhance gameplay, providing greater clarity and depth to the environment.  But the true genius of Counter-Strike 2 lies in its gameplay. The core mechanics that define Counter-Strike – the precise gunplay, the strategic depth, the heart-pounding tension of each round – remain, but they've been refined to near perfection. The new subtick system ensures that every action, every movement, every shot registers with unparalleled accuracy, making every kill feel incredibly satisfying.  The updated smoke grenades are a game-changer, adding a new layer of strategic complexity. The way they interact with the environment, filling spaces dynamically, opens up a world of tactical possibilities. Whether you're using them to block vision, create cover, or execute a perfectly timed push, the new smokes add a dynamic and exciting element to every match.  Counter-Strike 2 also introduces a host of other improvements, from the streamlined interface to the enhanced audio design. The sound of gunfire, the footsteps of approaching enemies, the subtle environmental cues – all contribute to a heightened sense of realism and immersion.  But beyond the technical improvements, Counter-Strike 2 captures the essence of what makes this game so special: the community. The thrill of competition, the camaraderie of teamwork, the shared experience of victory and defeat – these are the things that make Counter-Strike more than just a game; it's a phenomenon. And Counter-Strike 2 embraces and celebrates that community, providing a platform for players to connect, compete, and create memories that will last a lifetime.  In conclusion, Counter-Strike 2 is a masterpiece. It's a testament to the enduring power of tactical shooters, a celebration of community, and a glimpse into the future of competitive gaming. It's not just one of the best games I've ever played; it's a game that has redefined what's possible."

I’ve always had a soft spot for the older versions, but this version feels kind of neglected. There are cheaters everywhere, hitboxes feel off, and instead of fixing the real issues, it seems like the devs are more focused on pumping out new skins to make money. With the way it’s optimized and the state of the servers, I don’t really enjoy playing anymore. It’s a shame, because ""[i] CS:GO [/i]"" gave us so many amazing memories.

730,192991728,1744949534,1,38564,0.523809552192687988,"Here's a well-structured English review for CS2:   ---   **Counter-Strike 2: The Gold Standard of Tactical Shooters Just Got Better**   Valve's Counter-Strike 2 isn't just an update - it's a masterclass in how to evolve a legendary franchise while staying true to its roots. As someone who's spent countless hours since the 1.6 days, I can confidently say this is the most polished and thrilling iteration yet.   **Gameplay Perfection Refined**  The core DNA that made CS:GO an esports titan remains untouched, but subtle improvements elevate every match. The new sub-tick networking system is a revelation, making every bullet registration and movement tweak feel buttery smooth. Smoke grenades becoming dynamic volumetric objects adds unprecedented strategic depth - watching smoke swirl through bullet tracers never gets old.   **Visual Overhaul Done Right**  Source 2 engine works wonders without compromising performance. Maps like Overpass and Nuke glow with stunning lighting effects, while weapon models showcase incredible detail. The minimalist HUD redesign keeps focus on the action where it belongs.   **Sound Design Excellence**  From the crisp AK-47 echo in Mirage's apartments to the satisfying *clink* of a defuse kit, audio cues are now spatial masterpieces. I've literally dodged headshots based purely on sound positioning - that's next-level immersion.   **Community First Philosophy**  Valve's commitment to preserving skins/inventory while enabling full cross-play demonstrates rare respect for players. The new Workshop tools empower creators like never before, ensuring endless fresh content.   **Minor Growing Pains**  While the limited initial map pool and occasional server hiccups are noticeable, Valve's rapid update cadence shows they're listening. This is clearly a foundation built for decades, not quick cash grabs.   **Verdict**  Counter-Strike 2 isn't just the new king of tactical shooters - it's a love letter to competitive gaming. Whether you're a dusty veteran or fresh recruit, this is PC multiplayer at its"

The new Source 2 engine brings stunning lighting, sharper visuals, and cleaner maps without compromising the feel that made CS iconic.  ✅ Gunplay feels better than ever ✅ Smoke grenades are game-changers now (they interact with bullets and environment!) ✅ Matchmaking is faster and more balanced ✅ Movement and hit registration feel crisp ✅ Improved UI and stat tracking  Yeah, there are still some tweaks needed here and there, but Valve is clearly listening and improving it with each update. For anyone who’s been with CS since 1.6 or even just GO, this feels like the right step forward.  If you love tactical shooters with a high skill ceiling, this is still the gold standard. 💣🔥"

730,192941916,1744897698,0,1255,0.5,"There are too many hackers, and the Steam VAC system seems ineffective. I left the game two years ago because of this issue, but I recently created a new account, hoping that Valve and Steam had taken it seriously. Unfortunately, nothing has changed—in fact, the situation has worsened. The problem with hackers remains just as bad, if not worse than before.      I am deeply saddened to see such an iconic game—one that many of us grew up playing and holds a significant place in our childhood—being ruined by this issue. I can’t understand why this hasn’t been properly addressed unless there’s only one possible explanation: that you are actually creating these cheats and selling them for extra profit. If that’s the case, shame on you!"

730,192927272,1744878736,1,2991,0.5,Hackers literally make the game unplayable and until they do something about it you're better off going and playing Valorant (even if the abilites are not your thing) Just because you know the people you are facing are legit or atleast have a good chance of not cheating since their anti-cheat works :/ sucks aswell this game is really fun and the games where i actually dont run into any cheaters are really some of the most fun i've had in FPS games in along time.

730,192924535,1744875954,1,13080,0.5,"I never understood the appeal of this game when it first came out asides from the possible money making aspect it has. I was primarily an Xbox kid and the only FPS games I had ever played were CoD and Halo, so I had no nostalgia for Counter Strike or anything from Valve that wasn't included in the OrangeBox. When I first got this game I got it in a bundle alongside every other CS game and it sat in my steam library for over 7 years. It wasn't until recently when a friend asked me to get on where I actually played the game for the first time and I can finally say... I get it. This game legit has me addicted and I don't even know why? It's so outside my typical formula of games I like to play and yet for some reason I can't stop playing? Am I seriously too far gone, is there something chemically wrong inside my body that's making me enjoy this game? This games VAC is so horrible I play with Blatant cheaters in Premier and yet for some odd reason I still like this game.  It's free now, so you're not really hurting yourself by downloading it, so might as well..."

For some reason new accounts immediately are put into ""low trust""? Even tho the prime status is purchased. $12 completely wasted, dog shit dog ass dog water whatever the fuck the lingo is. Also the movement with the new game engine is fucking trash. I had about 2000+ in csgo and after 25hrs of cs2 i would have uninstalled if not for my friend.

Часов наиграно немало и что могу сказать - игра заберет у вас много времени, подарит вам множество позитивных и негативных эмоций, но в конце концов, если вы соберетесь играть в нее ради каких-либо достижений в соло - вы разочаруетесь.  Античит - больная проблема, которая так и не была пофикшена.  Премьер режим - похож на парад прокаженных, те кто играют в него поймут почему.  С выходом CS 2, многие мои знакомые, ушли в режим - играю ради еженедельного фарма крейта, и я в том числе, ибо желания хоть как то трайхардить ради заветной цифры\лычки рейтинга уже нет и не будет."

Whether you’re chilling with friends or sweating in competitive, the game is insanely addictive.  Yeah, it’s true, the gameplay often favors the “run & shoot in the head” style, and shotguns can feel kinda cheaty sometimes (looking at you, MAG-7 and Nova up close 😅), but still, the overall feel is unmatched.  Nothing beats the adrenaline of a 1v3 clutch, a perfectly placed smoke, or a clean headshot. It’s not perfect, but that’s what makes it fun, controlled chaos."

The Source 2 engine really elevates the feel of the game — everything looks sharper and runs smoother (depending on your rig).  That said, it’s not without its issues. Some legacy features are missing, the new UI can feel clunky, and there are occasional bugs or hit-reg frustrations. Matchmaking is still a mixed bag, and community servers/mods are somewhat limited compared to CS:GO (for now)."

Constantly talking to their friend in team voice chat, and no one understands a word. 4.The Valorant Player – Only here to say how bad this game is and quit. Refuses to play anything but their own game. Always getting one-tapped with pre-aim or can’t control the AK spray pattern then start screaming aimbot (Ye VAC suc We knew)"

730,192817643,1744743070,0,245923,0.5,"its just a shallow copy of csgo. Besides graphics - whole game is a downgrade. Scamtick - u run u win, holding angle is mission impossible, bhop impossible, every action is delayed. Valve simply wanted to save money and stay at 64tick, so we got this. Same situation with VAC, they developed AI anti cheat - wich is completley useless. For past month every 5th game Ive played had cheater on enemy team or mine or both. Guys where shooting thick walls with AWP, insta HS - but its too hard for AI VAC to detect it, Ive seen guys with knifes and gloves who use aim trigger. The state of the game is a joke. Like in csgo days 5 cheaters per year was maximum, but now they even fak up the trust factor so no matter if u have skins or not, how long u play, 25k rating or 15k rating - u will get cheaters.     Ok lets imagine u dont see cheaters, and u so noob that scamtick doesnt annoy u - game didnt have any content since launch, 90% csgo game modes are still not ported, surf dead, kz dead, custom servers in general just dead.

730,192804535,1744730599,1,112399,0.5,"As a longtime fan of the Counter-Strike franchise, Counter-Strike 2 feels like a solid modernization of the iconic tactical shooter. Powered by the Source 2 engine, the visual upgrade is immediately noticeable — maps look cleaner, lighting is dynamic, and character models are more detailed without losing that classic CS identity.  What I liked:  Improved visuals and physics: The upgraded graphics make the game feel fresh, especially on legacy maps like Dust2 and Mirage. Smoke grenades are now volumetric and reactive to environment and gunfire, which adds a new layer of strategy.  Performance: Despite the graphical overhaul, the game runs smoothly even on mid-tier machines.  Hit registration and movement: These feel more consistent and fluid compared to CS:GO, especially with sub-tick updates.  UI/UX overhaul: The main menu, scoreboard, and buy menu have all been refreshed and are more intuitive.  What I disliked:  Missing features at launch: Some features from CS:GO, like certain community maps, weapon skins, or modes, were initially absent or buggy. It's improving with updates, but the launch felt incomplete.  Matchmaking issues: Ranked play still needs polish. There are occasional long queue times and questionable matchmaking decisions.  Learning curve: Like all CS games, it’s brutally punishing for newcomers. There’s no real onboarding or tutorial — you either learn by fire or get left behind.  Final Thoughts: Counter-Strike 2 doesn’t reinvent the wheel — and it doesn’t need to. It builds on the tight gameplay foundation of CS:GO and brings the franchise into a new era. It’s not perfect, but for fans of tactical shooters, it’s definitely worth playing.  Recommended? Yes, especially for CS veterans. New players might need some patience, but the gameplay depth is unmatched once you get the hang of it."

If you've always dreamed of playing a ""Guess Which of These 10 Players Is Actually Human"" simulator, then CS2 is the perfect game for you! Valve apparently decided that a competitive shooter was too boring, so they added a ""Russian Roulette with Cheaters"" mode.    Pros:   - Free! (Because otherwise, no one would suffer through this.)   - Great training for your nervous system. Nothing toughens you up like losing a round to a guy named xX_Aimbot_God_Xx who wallbangs with 98% headshots.   - Bots on your team are like a side quest—""Escort the Potatoes Out of the Blast Zone""—except there’s no reward.    Cons:   - Anti-cheat? Never heard of it. VAC is about as effective as a cartoon cop who shows up after the fight is over.   - The game has turned into ""Who Can Buy Private Cheats First."" Lobbies feel like the dark web, but with more Russian screaming.   - ""Practice"" bots in Deathmatch only teach you one thing—how to quit the game fast and cry into your pillow.    Verdict: CS2 isn’t a sequel—it’s a social experiment: ""How many cheaters can a player endure before breaking?"" If you enjoy wasting your time and sanity, welcome aboard! For everyone else, I recommend playing literally anything else. Even Minesweeper. At least the bots there don’t camp the bomb site."

The odds of that happening are so incredibly low, unless the games anti-cheat just doesn't work (it doesn't). FACEIT does a much better job of assuring that you don't get matched with cheaters. Yeah- a 3rd party app does a better job than this billion dollar industry. If a game's reliability and legitimacy has to rely on a 3rd party software to maintain the life of the game, then there are some serious problems that need fixing."

Out of 10 lobbies you get:  5 - having a blatant cheater, not even trying to hide their hacks. And I mean it: killing all the enemies from spawn though walls.    3 - Autistic kids/trolls teamkilling you at spawn for the lulz while screaming their lungs out in voice comms.   1 - You get teammates where you really wonder how they even managed to turn on their PC.  1 - lobby which is actually playable.     On top of that you get kept hostage in these games with no way to surrender. Even if there is a 30/0 Cheater on the enemy team you still have to suffer through 10-15 minutes of this mockery of a game.     Cheating and griefing is actively supported in this game.     It is literally unplayable. What a sad excuse of a game."

Every match confirm intense one — must use strategy, aim properly, and teamwork is super important.  The guns all got pattern wan, so you cannot just simply shoot. You need to learn how to control the recoil, then only can play well. Map also very classic — Dust2, Mirage, all still very popular.  But ah, not so easy for beginner. First time play, maybe you kena headshot non-stop. But slowly slowly you learn, then can carry your team also. Got many toxic players sometimes, but if you play with friends, more shiok.  Graphics not the best lah, but no need fancy graphics — gameplay solid already. Plus, the competitive scene quite strong, got many tournaments, Malaysia also got some pro players.  Overall, if you like shooting games, CS:GO is still one of the best. Can play for years and still won't boring."

730,192701482,1744588593,0,414226,0.5,I would have 100% recommended this game if it were anything like CS:GO.. CS2 has completely ruined the game. Terrible anti-cheat and functions of the game need work. Should have kept this game in beta until it was fully complete. Wish i could go back to CS:GO again.

A lot of cheaters on casual games, random hit boxes, but most annoying of all, VAC failures. Imagine in the middle of the game you're kicked because Valve couldn't do some stuff in the background. And then there's no easy way to restart the game, you should try many things to see which one will help you to start the game again. That's it, that was my last play.

I was excited at first then i played it, the hit reg sucks, bullet spread is ass, you run and you have full accuracy, peakers advantage, broken matchmaking. This game has so much potential, only if the devs actually did something, there isn't even a functioning AC."

730,192672409,1744560298,1,23063,0.5,"Counter-Strike 2 has arrived as a breath of fresh air, yet also a familiar friend. As someone who's been deeply invested in the Counter-Strike series for the past 25 years, it's incredible to reflect on the journey from the humble beginnings of the original mod to this latest iteration. The core gameplay mechanics—precise aiming, strategic teamwork, and the iconic maps—remain refreshingly intact, serving as a testament to the timeless quality of Counter-Strike's gameplay formula.  Playing CS2 with my real-life friends continues to be an unparalleled experience. The excitement of coordinating a well-executed strategy, the adrenaline rush during clutch situations, and the camaraderie built through countless matches remain unmatched by any other gaming experience. Valve has managed to enhance visuals and refine gameplay mechanics subtly yet significantly, making CS2 feel modern and responsive without sacrificing the classic feel that long-time fans like myself cherish.  However, despite these positives, one persistent issue continues to cast a shadow over the overall experience—cheating. Valve has historically struggled with managing cheaters, and unfortunately, this issue has persisted into Counter-Strike 2. It's disheartening to encounter players who exploit hacks, ruining matches that would otherwise be exciting and fair competitions. My enjoyment, and that of my friends, is frequently diminished due to these negative experiences.  Furthermore, Valve's Trust Factor system, which is meant to reduce these encounters, hasn't been as effective as I'd hoped. Despite playing clean and consistently positive behavior, I find myself matched against suspicious opponents far too frequently. Enhancing the accuracy and responsiveness of the Trust Factor system would greatly improve the overall matchmaking experience, encouraging fair play and maintaining the integrity of the competitive scene.  In conclusion, Counter-Strike 2 represents both a beautiful evolution of the franchise and a significant opportunity for Valve to address longstanding issues. After 25 years, my passion for this game remains strong, driven by friendship and the enduring thrill of competitive play. Yet, Valve's action on combating cheating and refining the Trust Factor system could genuinely elevate Counter-Strike 2 from great to extraordinary. Here's hoping they rise to the occasion."

These cheaters are the kind of people to flex in the mirror at themselves as they walk by, but obtain nothing in real life lol  When players get wrecked & straight up type in the chat that they are going to toggle and then massacre our entire team with a deagle through walls as all headshots, something should probably be done.   Again, great game, but i cannot recommend CS2 in its current state as an enjoyable Friday night competitive game.  Quite sad  Play for fun, not competition, as it does not pay deep enough respect to the more competitive fan base.  ***For example this guy has two accounts and wall hacks and aim bots with his 3 stack.

730,192584162,1744469239,0,285,0.505730688571929932,"Unfortunately, I can't agree with the hype surrounding Counter-Strike 2. As a long-time fan of CS:GO, I had high hopes, but CS2 feels like a step backwards in many places.  Technical problems: The game still suffers from serious bugs, lags and performance issues months after release. Many players report FPS drops and instability, even on high-end PCs. Netcode problems and poor hit registers mean that you can't hit the target reliably even with a good response time - which is absolutely crucial in a game like CS.  Gameplay & Movement: Compared to CS:GO, the movement feels spongier and less precise. Classics such as Counter Punishment no longer work properly, which has a negative impact on skill-based gameplay. Many veterans complain that the game “no longer feels like Counter-Strike”.  Missing features & content: Numerous features from CS:GO are simply missing: some game modes, maps or even functions in the menu have been removed without replacement or are incompletely integrated. Community servers and workshop support are also severely limited.  Matchmaking & Anti-Cheat: Matchmaking is still frustrating. Cheaters are still a major problem and the VAC system is just as ineffective as before. Fair games are often pure chance.  Conclusion: Counter-Strike 2 feels more like an unfinished tech demo on the Source 2 engine than a worthy successor. Those who loved CS:GO will miss many of the old strengths here. Maybe it will be better in the future - but right now it feels like a premature release that brings more frustration than joy."

I understand that there's a balance between limits of Server-side processing and Giving to much information to Players Client application, but still, its valve for gods sake, figure something out. game is not bad, but overall experience is 1/10 for this reason.

I was all hyped for the upgrade, but honestly, it feels like the devs just axed a ton of the features that made the old games so much fun. Remember surfing, hide and seek, and those epic zombie maps? Gone. And with the community browser missing too, it's like all those cool custom games and mods we used to dive into are just history.  On top of that, the cheater issue still isn't fixed. It's 2025, and the anti-cheat system is still not up to par this ruins the competitive vibe completely. The game feels wonky overall, with clunky movement and weird physics, making matches feel more like a beta test than a polished product.  I get that change is inevitable and the devs might be trying to push for something new, but they’ve tossed out the stuff that gave us a unique community vibe. Hopefully, future patches address these problems and maybe even bring back some of the lost features. As it stands, CS2 feels like it's lost its soul, and that’s a real shame for longtime fans."

We didn’t have smoke physics. We had square clouds that looked like a broken vape. And we liked it.  Let me walk you through my experience booting this thing up:  Step 1: Download a 50-gigabyte update to play a game I’ve been playing since Bush was president. Step 2: Try to find de_dust2. Step 3: Realize it’s been “reimagined” with lighting so realistic I need sunglasses indoors.  The guns? Too many buttons now. I tried to quickswitch with my old binds and instead threw a decoy grenade that sounded like a duck choking on a kazoo. And don’t get me started on the AWP. I used to one-tap dreams with that bad boy. Now it feels like it’s coated in molasses. Also, everyone jumps around corners like caffeinated kangaroos.  The players? Back in 2003, you LANed with your boys in someone’s mom’s basement, drinking flat Mountain Dew and screaming across the room. Now? Now I get headshot in 0.3 seconds by someone named ""xX420DankSniperXx"" using a $900 anime skin and a VPN from space.  Yes, the smoke physics are cool. Yes, the Source 2 engine is sleek. But it just feels wrong. Too clean. Too modern. I want jank. I want the raw Counter-Strike. I want to bunny hop off a crate and knife a dude in 4 pixels.  Bring back 1.6. Or at least give me the dignity of a server browser that doesn't feel like I'm filing taxes."

I reached lvl 10 to play premier but even there are cheaters. I think I will search for a private server that are punishing the cheaters. Sadly they are not giving experience.

730,192532370,1744409167,1,91263,0.5,"Counter-Strike 2 is the perfect game if you’ve ever wanted to spend 40 minutes being yelled at by a 14-year-old with the tactical instincts of a squirrel and the confidence of a Navy SEAL.    The graphics are excellent, which really helps when you want to watch your own ragdoll body flop over in glorious 1440p after peeking mid for the 37th time in a row. The lighting system is beautiful, too. I especially enjoy the detailed shadows and reflections — which I stare at for a solid 90% of the game because I’m dead.    Gameplay is exactly what you’d expect: two teams, one objective, and no one actually following the plan. Everyone has a microphone, and they all use it exclusively for ASMR chip crunching or motivational speeches like “bro why are you so bad.” Riveting.    Guns are varied and realistic. I appreciate the attention to detail — every weapon behaves differently, and none of them seem interested in hitting what I aim at. The AWP is a great choice if you enjoy standing still and being judged by five strangers every time you miss a shot worth $4,750.    There’s also a ping system, which is mostly used to mark bomb sites long after the bomb has exploded. A nice reminder of what could’ve been.    Occasionally, I win a match. I don’t know how. It just happens. Like lightning strikes, or someone actually using a smoke grenade properly.    Would recommend. Especially if you enjoy high-stress environments, mild emotional damage, and developing a lifelong distrust of random teammates."

Due to some past unjust VAC bans, I didn’t dare buy the game on my main account, so I couldn’t play with my friends at the time. Looking back, I realize how foolish that was. Now, my friends aren’t around anymore, and I deeply regret not enjoying those moments with them.  The game itself is incredible — refined gameplay, great graphics, and a solid community. But the time I missed out on still lingers with me. If you’re thinking about getting into the game, don’t make the same mistake I did. Cherish the time with your friends, because you never know how quickly it can slip away."

In old CS 1.6 there were at least admins on servers who were using amx commands to ban kids with cheats. So going back to old better version of CS"

That said, it’s 1AM, the boys are on, and I just triple-whiffed a deagle shot—so yeah, it still does the job.  I’ve been playing for years and I still get outgunned by someone named xX420SniperBabyXx holding W with a MAC-10.  But that’s the magic. CS2, while missing some of CSGO’s grit, still delivers the core experience: precision aiming, pixel-perfect peeking, and that eternal quest to finally master the AK spray pattern.   The challenge is what makes it addicting. No battle pass fluff or hand-holding—just you, a bomb site, and a dream."

The maps? Shiny, bright, and cleaner than my search history after incognito mode. Dust2 looks like it got a skincare routine and started therapy. Mirage is still Mirage though. Eternal. Unchanged.

730,192436735,1744299305,0,182708,0.5,"Ever since they switched to Counter strike 2 the game has been awful. I will preface with the fact that I've played CS 1.6, CS Source and CS:GO, so this is in no way coming from a place of simply hating the new game. I never felt this way switching from any of the other games. Sadly this is simply because CS2 is the worst iteration of the game since Condition Zero.  In CS:GO you had responsive movement and cohesive mechanics that were consistent at all times.  CS2 Has taken a massive step backwards in the evolution of the game.  The sub-tick system they've been very keen on showing off has only had negative results associated with it. It makes the game feel less responsive and that in turn creates problems with the gameplay and gun play.  The game feels less like a game you become better at with time, and moreso a very RNG game with little to no skill curve and lower skill ceiling, especially since they made the SMGs extremely overpowered which has shifted the game towards way more of a run and gun shooter.  And this is excluding all the game breaking smaller bugs that have plagued the game since launch. Those are simply to many to count. And I wont delve deeper but I will finish by saying that the cheating problem has never been more severe and problematic. It is quite literally impossible to play the game for an entire day and not encounter hackers.   All of this, paired with no real updates, no new features, no new content and absolutely no anti-cheat, CS2 is by far the worst Valve product in years.  If you are thinking of getting into CS. Don't, simply just don't do it. This is sadly a dumpsterfire with no end in sight."

730,192413892,1744270414,0,26810,0.5,"Never thought I'd write a review for this game, but here we are! Let's take a trip down memory lane - I first played this back in high school when dial-up internet was still a thing. Oh, how far we've come! While the graphics might seem dated compared to modern titles, they've improved leaps and bounds since those early days.    Remembering those dial-up struggles still gives me PTSD - one phone call and BAM! Instant disconnect from the game. Those were the days...    But here's why I can't recommend this game today: the community has become absolutely toxic over its 25-year lifespan. I remember when local net cafes hosted Counter-Strike tournaments with actual sportsmanship and prizes. That friendly competition is long gone.    Now when I log on (with my sadly diminished reflexes), all I find is a cesspool of trash talk, screaming matches, and players tearing each other apart over every mistake. Gaming should be competitive but fun - this is just miserable. The community has turned into something truly awful, sucking all enjoyment out of what was once a great experience.    Verdict: A nostalgic relic that's been ruined by its own player base."

If you really think this organization care about unfair cheating players, you must be dumb :D  Basically cheating in CS is like taking doping in mma, for example. Which is making game pointless.  I used wallhack one time in my life in CS 1.6 (yeah, around 2004 year) and remember making pistol ace. Everybody was like Wow man, but I was disgusted inside and never used it again because something felt off. And... somebody doing this on a daily basis and Valve praising it. How even possible?  This is basically non-regulated on a law level and thats why cs2 people and Valve think this is normal and getting away with this.

Valve has lost its mind with this game.     Period point blank, if you own a OLED monitor, this game will absolutely crash, A LOT. When CS2 came out it was really exciting to get to experience CS with high end graphics that my machine more than supports. This game will crash, crash, then crash some more. NO MATTER what I do, what resolution I am on, what settings I use, no amount of ""-novolumetrics -dx11 -disable_d3d9ex -nojoy -noubershader +fps_max 240 -refresh 240 -fullscreen"" makes this shit stay open for longer than 5 minutes. I have tried everything to fix it and it comes down to this game not being properly optmized which is hilarious in 2025. You know what game doesn't crash? VALORANT.    CS2 is a glorified gambling sim and the only reason there's players left at all is because Valve doesn't know what to do with the multi-million dollar economy they created from cases, which even with that they hardly put out anything. These fat neckbeardian lifers of this game like to point to Riot and say BUT MUH DATA BUT THE INVASIVE ANTI CHEAT!!!! At least VALORANT has a working fucking anti-cheat. I have friends who have cheated for YEARS on CSGO and onward into CS2. It's borderline allowed. Which leaves you with the option to play on dogshit Faceit servers, which oh boy, some third party company thatis definitely being safe with the very data you think multibillion dollar company Riot isn't being safe with.    This game is only nostalgia, is propped up by the whitest, fattest, most basement dwelling fringe group online, and like EVERY other Valve game is just a overrated piece of shit game that isn't held to the standards we hold LITERALLY every other game.     Also Valve has been caught stealing data, selling it, etc more times than Riot ever has or will.     Google is free, fuck this game, fuck you."

Lack of QoL features, i.e. vertical sensivity multiplier present in most normal shooters.

You even start doubting actual good players. Whenever you sense the slightest hint of unfairness the game becomes less enjoying because you never know if it is just another cheater or just a good player.  In addition to that, Valve seems to be unwilling to change the situation that has been present basically since the CS2 release. The only notable changes seem to be more cash grabs."

730,192309190,1744136733,1,22564,0.586678981781005859,"🇬🇧 English: My journey with Counter-Strike began back in the days of version 1.5. I fell in love with the pure competitive spirit hidden within those simple pixels. Every round, every clutch moment, every aim duel stirred a unique excitement inside me. CS wasn’t just a game to me—it was a passion, a love, a way of life. I spent days grinding, nights without sleep, dreaming of becoming a pro. I wanted to wear a team jersey, compete in tournaments, and hear my name echo in the arena. But talent alone wasn’t enough, and the circumstances at the time didn’t work in my favor. Still, the fire in me never faded.  As the years passed, versions evolved—CS 1.6, Source, Global Offensive—and I followed them all. I was always there, part of it. But eventually, the unfairness within the game—especially the cheaters—began to drain my love for it. Every match started to feel pointless. ""Was there a cheater again?"" became my routine question.  At some point, I gave in. I betrayed the purity of my passion. I told myself, “If everyone else is doing it, why not me?” I deeply regret it to this day. I ended up getting my most valuable accounts—full of years of effort and memories—banned. The shame of those actions still lingers within me like a scar.  But even through all that, I never stopped loving CS. Because CS was a reflection of me. The sounds of gunfire, the ticking bombs, the mid-round calls—they became the soundtrack of my youth. The discipline, reaction speed, and mental strength I developed thanks to CS helped me far beyond the screen.  Now, CS2 is here. With a brand-new engine, more realistic physics, advanced lighting and shadows—it offers a fresh, immersive experience. But to be honest, it still needs work. Optimization issues, matchmaking problems, and bugs still affect gameplay. However, that doesn't mean it can’t improve. CS has always been a game that evolves and matures over time.  Counter-Strike is my childhood love. My first passion. My first real thrill. And that kind of love never dies. It only transforms. CS will live on forever—because it lives in us. In the players who gave their hearts to it.  CS never dies. It simply gets reborn.  🇹🇷 Türkçe: Counter-Strike serüvenim 1.5 sürümüyle başladı. O basit piksellerin içinde saklı o saf rekabet ruhuna âşık oldum. Her round, her clutch anı, her aim kapışması içimde ayrı bir heyecan yaratıyordu. CS benim için sadece bir oyun değildi—bir tutkuydu, bir aşktı, bir yaşam biçimiydi. Günlerce oynadım, gecelerce uykusuz kaldım. Profesyonel olmak istedim. Takım forması giymek, turnuvalara katılmak, ismimi arenada duymak... Ama yetenek tek başına yetmedi, o zamanki şartlar da buna izin vermedi. Yine de içimdeki o kıvılcım hiç sönmedi.  Yıllar geçtikçe sürümler değişti—CS 1.6, Source, Global Offensive—ve ben hepsini takip ettim. Hep içindeydim, bir parçasıydım. Ama zamanla, özellikle hileciler yüzünden oyundaki adaletsizlik sevgimi tüketmeye başladı. Her maçın ardından aklımda tek bir cümle dönüp duruyordu: “Yine hile mi vardı?”  Bir noktada ben de yenik düştüm. O tertemiz tutkumu kirlettim. “Herkes yapıyor, ben de deneyeyim” dedim. Bugün hâlâ pişmanım. Yıllarca emek verdiğim, anılar biriktirdiğim en değerli hesaplarım ban yedi. O anların utancı hâlâ içimde bir yara gibi duruyor.  Ama tüm bunlara rağmen CS’yi sevmekten asla vazgeçmedim. Çünkü CS, bana ayna tutuyordu. Silah sesleri, bombaların tıkırtısı, round ortasında gelen takım çağrıları—gençliğimin fon müziği oldu. CS sayesinde geliştirdiğim refleks, disiplin ve mental direnç ekranın ötesine geçti; hayatta da bana yol gösterdi.  Ve şimdi CS2 geldi. Yepyeni bir oyun motoru, daha gerçekçi fizik kuralları, gelişmiş ışık ve gölge efektleriyle taze ve derin bir deneyim sunuyor. Ama dürüst olmak gerekirse hâlâ eksikleri var. Optimizasyon sıkıntıları, eşleştirme sorunları ve bazı hatalar oyun keyfini baltalıyor. Ancak bu gelişmeyeceği anlamına gelmiyor. CS her zaman zamanla gelişen ve olgunlaşan bir oyun oldu.  Counter-Strike benim çocukluk aşkım. İlk tutkum. İlk gerçek heyecanım. Ve böyle bir aşk asla ölmez. Sadece şekil değiştirir. CS sonsuza dek yaşayacak—çünkü onu yaşatan bizleriz. Ona kalbini vermiş oyuncular.  CS asla ölmez. Sadece yeniden doğar."

I’ll never forget the first time I played Counter-Strike 1.6 on my old desktop, the thrill of competing with friends over LAN. The game was a challenge, and every win felt earned. Fast forward to CS:GO, and that same excitement is still there. The mechanics are tight, the strategy deep, and the community, while tough - keeps me coming back.  What I love most is how CS:GO has grown with me. The maps, the sounds, and even the familiar ""terrorists win"" call take me back to simpler times. It's not just about the game itself but the memories and friendships that have come with it. Even after all these years, CS:GO remains a constant, a piece of my past and present. For me, it’s a timeless experience that I’ll always cherish"

When i turn 18 i could finally use steam without limit and could buy whatever i want on steam.  That being said, When Valve decided to make CSGO better i was looking forward to it. better graphics and some Smoke mechanics. it was pretty exciting. Until the day that i could grind CS:GO on my very own personal account. is the day Valve killed CS:GO. Also the day CS2 was born. And i can't enjoy the game as much as i did with CS:GO. I've reached Global and practice hard on community practice maps. but as cool as CS2 update was. Something about CS2 is missing that CSGO had.  SO CS2 is 6/10 for me. and CSGO is 8/10."

I've tried everything I can think of to fix hidden latency issues but, nothing has made the slightest bit of difference, as soon as a round starts it like a bag of rubber bands"

They toggle so it'll be impossible to tell who is who and what's what. Ai will ban the wrong people repeatedly. It wont get better and it'll be a worse anticheat than anything we've gotten before. At least in my opinion. I don't think too many things, but when I do I think smarts. My smarts tell me this is a bad idea and way too many cheaters will be able to run through this unscathed.

730,192177264,1743978353,0,2602,0.5,"Cheaters in petty much every game-     I got a 2nd account to play with my boyfriend who is brand new to CS and playing on my main was difficult when I have decent prem/ comp/ wingman rank, he had no chance to learn at a new level. I already struggle myself in 15k+ games (since 2nd season it refused to rank me lower than 18k) so wanted to start from scratch and work my way back up. I am not myself a great player so didn't feel too unfair to just play some chill games with him as he figured it out and learnt the game. Well It has been an unenjoyable experience for us both and I hate to think this is how any new player finds CS2. Pretty much every game has had 1-3 blatant cheaters with fresh level 1 accounts, crazy K/D stats on their accs, shooting like globals but playing like silvers (that or they are in fact global smurfs). Game sense out of this world (aka walls). I have had to report more players in the span of 2 months than the 3+ years I have played this game. And only one player who shot me through a wall with no sound q/ not a usual prefire bangable spot got banned. I have never been one to say 'they are cheating,' but now every game it is my go to. I feel so bad that this has been my bfs experience of CS and mine from a new players perspective. I thought I would have to downplay my skill for new/low rated players, but turns out I am the one struggling most games, getting headshot by running deagle and AK players- who apparently don't need to counter strafe or worry about recoil, shot through walls and smokes. These players hold the tightest angles, no jiggle peaking. literally holding the wall until you peak and don't miss a single shot... anyway you get the picture. This game has been a cheaters paradise for too long (not so bad if you have an established acc on prem but even then we all know 25k+ is majority of cheaters).

730,192169764,1743971041,1,56079,0.5,"Counter-Strike 2 isn’t just a game — it’s a lifestyle. One moment you feel like John Wick, next moment you get one-tapped by someone jumping around with a P90 named 'Spray & Pray'. I’ve developed trust issues from fake bomb plants, PTSD from flashbangs, and a sixth sense for when someone’s camping in a corner. My reflexes are sharp, my aim is questionable, and my decision-making depends entirely on how loud the bomb beeps. But hey — as long as I get MVP once every 20 games, I consider myself a pro   Played CS2 to relax tho. Now my mouse is broken, my desk has a fist mark, and I'm arguing with a 12-year-old from Russia. Also new CS2 physics are cool — finally my team has an excuse for missing every shot.  11/10 game - I would recommend!"

730,192169234,1743970622,1,45553,0.5,"Rating: 8.5/10  Counter-Strike 2 brings a much-needed visual and engine upgrade to the classic shooter, now running on the Source 2 engine. The graphics are cleaner, smoke grenades are more dynamic, and the UI feels modern and polished.  Gameplay remains true to CS:GO, with tight gunplay and strategic depth. Some new features like sub-tick servers aim to improve performance, but the community is still split on their effectiveness.  The launch had a few hiccups—missing features, bugs, and mixed reactions from competitive players—but Valve is actively improving the game.  Overall, CS2 is a solid update that respects the legacy of CS:GO while pushing it into a new era."

730,192138470,1743947378,0,124729,0.630899131298065186,"I have been playing counter-strike since it was a mod, before Valve bought the rights and before steam was even a thing. I have had no issues until CS:GO where hackers seemed to go unchecked and if you tried to report anyone valve wouldn't let you for a time and said they have a full proof anti-cheat method. CS2 was coming out and I was excited for it since it would be an upgrade to visuals and gameplay. It has some improvements but hackers are still a problem more in comp and premier than in casual surprisingly.    Steam from the articles I have read are using AI and a report from another player to catch cheaters now, this however is showing false positives, there are videos discussing this in more detail where the number of ""caught"" cheaters has increased exponentially. I myself have not cheated in any game, ran any scripts, etc. Yet I have now been punished twice in two different pods of 5 despite no actual vac bans and no word on who was even suspected of cheating, instead we get a generic message of ""Irregular Gameplay"" and the whole team is penalized. First time was 20 hours, I figured I just won't play with those guys again as I only knew one of them anyways. The second time I met 3 clan guys friended one of them and ran with one of their friends and the match ended early. We were losing both matches by a lot and we suspected the top frag player on the other team of hacking given how great he was compared to everyone else. The second time was a 3 day cooldown and since I don't hack I opened a steam ticket and almost 3 days later there is no response. I have spent a lot of money on opening cases and everything so I find it very crappy that Steam/Valve has decided to ignore my ticket and derank me a second time on premier when I was not cheating at all.    I have friends who play premier and I want to play with them which is why I was getting my rank up which peak was around 3500 which isn't very high. Most of my friends got theirs up to 10k+ and the game doesn't allow you to play if the level difference is too high, which I understand the reason is so players don't get boosted. My issue now is that I am forced to play with full randos as if I join a stack, I risk getting cooldowned again or banned if someone else is cheating or has ""Irregular Gameplay"".     I will still play the game but I don't see a point in trying to do comp or premier anymore nor do I see the point in spending money in a game that allows actual cheaters to play the game while penalizing those it just thinks might be cheating. This makes me want to go to back to COD but most of my friends play CS2. If you are looking for a game to play competitive this game is definitely not it.     Cheating is not the only reason not to get this game, CS2 has been out for 2 years and I was a little down that they eliminated a lot of maps, but they brought new versions at the same time. They announced they were bringing new maps, for hostage rescue, there are only 2 maps where before we had more. I would have thought that we would get 2 new hostage maps but both times they released 2 maps for a total of 4, they were defusal maps and the first two weren't for casual or comp but only wingman (2 v2). They release skins and they are nice but cheating is a problem, since Q3 of last year flagging accounts who aren't cheating has been a problem and we still only have 2 hostage maps that one has always been since beta the other since 2000, 25 years old. Meanwhile most of the defusal maps are newer or have had major upgrades to design layout.    If you already own the game, sure you can keep playing it but if Valve/Steam continues in the direction they have been headed they will destory the player base for this game. If you don't own this game, I do not recommend you buy it and purchase price is they charge money to play premier/comp, 15 dollars. It isn't worth it."

One of the most frustrating things about the game is the constant presence of cheaters, and unfortunately, Valve hasn’t found a solution to this issue. No matter what league you play in—whether it’s Silver, Nova, or even Global Elite—you’re bound to come across someone using cheats. If you take a look at the features of these cheats, you’d be shocked, so it’s something you really need to watch out for while playing."

Still, I enjoy this game for its simplicity yet difficult mastery. Good tactical 5v5 to just hop into and have a good time, (or bad depending on the enemy team). Not to mention the common russian teamate that will begin screaming racial slurs down the mic to one of you guys because you messed up a grenade or something that leads to a massive arguement. Those guys are funny and make the experience better. This game also has alot of history, another cool thing about CS."

At first? You’ll suck. The aiming feels weird, counter-strafing makes no sense, and utilities? Yeah, good luck figuring those out.  But give it time. Like... 100 hours. Then suddenly it clicks. And it’s actually fun. Like, “yell at your screen and high-five your mouse” fun.  The community though? Oh boy. It’s a mix of legends, gremlins, and people who probably haven’t touched grass in months. Toxic? Sometimes. Funny? Occasionally. Mentally draining? Yes.  Also—cheaters. They exist. And Valve? Well... they’re kinda just watching it all happen. Maybe sipping coffee. Who knows.  Still, if you love a good challenge, some rage, and the occasional god-tier clutch... CS2 delivers.  Just... bring snacks. And patience."

You know its nice with the initial love-bombing of nostalgia. The community is even worse often resorting to cynical highly-toxic short engaged conversations. You then have to somehow break through their hardened exterior shell which is like a game in itself. I'm telling you, it would take years of therapy to get groundbreaking progress with some of these members of the community. Very Unstable, they do however have PTSD from cheaters not properly held accountable, and terrible drop rates on the cases. Cases have been the issue of lawsuits for valve. Even over all of this i know after i uninstall, i will be back a week later, a month later, maybe even a half a year, hell maybe even several years. 0/10 do not recommend see you on the comp field boys."

730,192051874,1743865460,1,179196,0.5,"Counter Strike is a team game for people who like self-harm. This game is like a drug, you know that after turning it on you will feel like you want to slit your wrists, but you still turn it on just like with drugs.   The goal of the game is to cooperate with individuals who have had a lobotomy and on top of that, each of them has the ego of the director of the globe. During the game, you will often have the urge to whip someone with an electric cable, but you will quickly get used to it. At the beginning of the game, you spawn with 4 other people, two of whom don't have a microphone and you wish the other two didn't have one. Most of them do not even speak English and they shout various spells at the others.   The basic tactic in this game is to die first and curse at the others. If you are lucky enough and happen to win a game, do not forget to write ""gg ez noobs"" in the chat.  Feel free to click the ""play"" button, which actually means ""give me 4 mentally challenged individuals on my team"" to find out how many people are actually sleeping with your mother."

730,192032552,1743849041,1,8442,0.5,"Hacking in Counter-Strike is a huge problem that have caused many to quit the game. With Counter-Strike being so competitive, a hacker can really ruin your day. However, many players treat cheats as a joke, because they are misinformed about them. In this article we will go over all the hacks there are, how to spot CS:GO hackers, why you shouldn’t hack, and how to deal with a cheater. By the time you are done you will be a pro at dealing with those annoying scum bags!   Wallhacks First let’s review the most popular CS:GO hacks out there. Wallhacks are basically cheats that allow you to see players through walls and smokes, similar to spectator mode. These allow the cheater to hit insane wall bangs and pre fires and can be really maddening. On top of this, it’s hard to catch these hackers because they can simply say they got lucky when they hit these shots. Wall cheats are simple to use, so the users are often bad at disguising them, which is good for you.   Aimbots The next type of cheats we have to go over are aimbots. Aimbots are programs that move your crosshair right onto your opponent’s head and can be as subtle as a regular old flick to an insane half way across the map 180 no scope. Basically, you will get absolutely owned in every aim duel you take with these shady users.   Fast move The last type of assistance in this list are mobility cheats. These users can move faster than the average running speed and can “ghost” through walls. Basically, they get their inner Casper on and kill you by backstabbing you through a wall. All of these cheats are shady and unfair, and should not be used.   CS:GO hacks are very easy to use, which makes it really hard to end the blight that is defiling Counter-Strike. However, there is a bright spot. Because hacks are so easy to use, the downloaders are often blatant. Yes, spotting hackers is very easy once you know how and we will go over that soon. However, to all the possible cheaters out there, we as a community have a message for you. You are absolute jerks that no one likes and you will eventually be banned. If you are considering hacking, please don’t. It is annoying and ruins other people’s experience.   How do I spot a CS:GO hacker? That is the question many noobs ask when questioned about some doubts they had about cheaters. Well, we will go over that now so you can get on them right away. First of all, don’t report someone because they keep out aiming you. This will waste the Overwatch guy’s time and no one likes that one guy who accuses everyone. Only report someone if they are blatantly aim botting or walling. If you are not sure, simply record a GOTV demo of the footage and then make your decision. If the player hits one or two insane shots, they might just be lucky. Wait until you see a consistent suspicious pattern before reporting them.  Now you may be wondering how to report these bullies. Well, it is quite easy. Just find their name on the Tab menu, and right click on it. Click on submit a report and fill out the required info. Once you do this, a reputed member of the community will watch the suspicious uses footage and decide whether or not to ban them. This is called an Overwatch ban.   Types of punishment cs go vac banCheaters are punished in many different ways. The first type of ban is the VAC ban. These bans are when a computer system determines you are cheating. You are banned from competitive CS:GO and cannot trade any of your items. These bans are permanent, unappealable, and come with a trade ban that locks all your items into your account.  The next type of bans are Overwatch bans. These are community managed bans, where one user can report a user, and another can choose to ban him based on the evidence available. These are appealable but take forever due to a backlog of appeals. You don’t want to get either of these, as they basically ruin your ability to play Counter-Strike on those accounts.  How to solve the problem? Now you might wonder what Valve’s stance on this sensitive topic is. They are known to be absolutely no tolerance on cheaters and hate that their game is rife with them. So players don’t like cheats, and Valve doesn’t like them either. However, there will be those that will do it, and the best thing we can do is report and ban them.  A suggestion we have for dealing with hackers is to place them among other hackers. They will think that they are getting along unaffected while they are only being placed among other hackers. This will lower the amount of cheaters in regular servers as many cheaters have multiple accounts which they can use if one account is banned. A game that has used this system in the past is Titanfall, and I got the idea from the YouTube Warowl. It is a sensible idea that is easy to implement and would be very helpful."

(and some money) BUT TIME To sum it up: Loved this game for 15 years, over the years cheaters have become an increasing problem, Valve don't care. But love inherently makes you blind. Dopamine and siblings... They will get their moneyzz anyways. The community is too weak and addicted to gambling, it is not about the core anymore.

The game has changed, but not for the better. After CS GO became CS2, everything changed. It became impossible to play. Terrible hit registration, optimization problems (despite the fact that my system pulls the same Cyberpunk quite easily at maximum settings), constant freezes and crashes, a problem with cheaters, a strange hit prediction system and a bunch of other equally strange solutions, the lack of unique operatives on different maps, and so on. Maps are a separate pain. Many classic cards from the last game have sunk into oblivion. The overall design of the game has become too contrasting and oversaturated with colors. CS GO had a slight grayness, which gave it a special charm of a military tactical shooter.  Well, what became an extreme point for me was that the developers simply decided to abandon the old modes that were in CS GO. Especially the “Danger zone"". Just for the sake of her and other past modes, I endured and hoped that the game would pull through, but as I see it, the game is over. For me, CS2 has become a kind of half-corpse that is not allowed to die and at least try to get out.  I just don't feel like playing this game anymore, even though I've been familiar with this series since CS 1.6. It's a pity to see that the game is gradually sliding into the abyss. This is my personal opinion. At the moment, I'm going to look at the analogues I like, but I had enough for CS2.  Я разочарован в игре. Мне очень нравилось играть в свое время в CS GO и ее режимы. Но что мы видим сейчас. Игра изменилась, но не в лучшею сторону. После того как CS GO стала CS2 все изменилось. Играть стало невозможно. Ужасная регистрация попаданий, проблемы с оптимизацией (при том что моя система довольно легко тянет тот же Cyberpunk на максимальных настройках), постоянные зависания и вылеты, проблема с читерами, странная система предугадывания попаданий и куча других не менее странных решений, отсутствие уникальных оперативников на разных картах и прочее. Карты это отдельная боль. Многие классические карты из прошлой игры канули в небытие. Общий дизайн игры стал слишком контрастным и перенасыщенным красками. CS GO имела легкую серость, что давала ей особый шарм военно-тактического шутера.  Ну и что стало для меня крайней точкой так это то, что разработчики просто решили отказаться от старых режимов, которые были в CS GO. Особенно “Запретная зона”. Только ради нее и других прошлых режимов я терпел и надеялся что игра выкарабкается, но как я вижу игре конец. Для меня CS2 стала неким подобием полутрупа которому не дают умереть и хотя бы пытаться выкарабкаться.  У меня уже просто нет желания заходить в эту игру, хотя я знаком с этой серией еще с CS 1.6. Жалко видеть что игра постепенно скатывается в бездну. Это мое личное мнение. На данный момент я буду смотреть на приглянувшиеся аналоги, но для CS2 меня хватило."

Currently, players can accept a match by simply clicking the ""Accept"" button with the mouse. However, in Dota 2, you can accept a match by pressing the Enter key, which makes the process faster and more convenient. I believe that adding the same functionality to CS2 - allowing players to accept a match using the Enter key - would improve the user experience. This small change can improve accessibility and make it easier for many players to find partners. Thank you for considering this suggestion, and I appreciate all your work on CS2! Sincerely, From Ukraine."

Moreover, nothing says ""strategy"" like a cloud of smoke that can hide an entire team and the bomb.  It's the same high-octane, panic-inducing gameplay, just now with extra texture.

I thought when I bought this game that I would be able to see what the last game was all about. All I can say, is that this is not the same game compared to what it used to be. This game is now infested with cheaters, bots, and bullies. Valve can't stop bullying, but they also seem to be endorsing cheating by not fixing this issue. I have heard talk about a couple new counter strike games, but I am not sure if it is true. Either way, I won't be purchasing any sort of video game from Valve in the future, especially if they can't and won't fix this one. I am a ""free to play"" type of player, but this was an absolute waste of $15. Google any CS2 cheating videos and you will see the real gameplay.

730,191901371,1743710098,0,95547,0.5,"The year is 2028. Valve celebrate their 150th Case release with another rent-able case, this one costing twice as much. Tears roll out of my eyes as I queue up for another game, already predicting my loss. My teammates screech as we lose each round, unable to identify which player was at fault and you KNOW it was not your problem. The other team must be cheating, boosting, just having a better day. It's not you; it's the game. But hey, apparently another update looms in the near future - perhaps now they'll finally add another community-made map, maybe now they'll add cache? But no, just another collection in the Armory, and further discounts for the latest sticker capsule disappointment. Man, I miss the creativity and ingenuity of CS:GO, now we're left with a greedy money-grab that Valve have all but abandoned. Another one bites the dust. Yet somehow, it's still addictive. This game brings me nothing but rage and disappointment if I try, anguished laughter and annoyed teammates when I don't. Don't play this until some love is brought back to the game, not more skins. How about a new weapon? Gamemode? Anything but content that earns Valve money? Wishful thinking."

730,191894472,1743704167,0,6716,0.5,"I personally like the game and some of the community, but as a new player seeing what the games about, i would hate every aspect of it, as if you are a free to play not trying to spend money on games at all you will encounter so many hackers to a point that is not even funny, Also I feel that most people trying the game has heard of the skins but as a free to play or just someone with some or no income at all, wont have the joy of getting skins like others online have as is just a black hole in your wallet if you want to get skins, another thing is the lack of content getting put out, as from csgo to cs2 the amount of content went way down as so many maps are missing and once you played all the maps a couple of times you get sick of them as there's always just 3 maps that you will play as no body like the others. Overall unless you don't mind having skins, dealing with hackers, some toxic parts of the community and needing to play daily to be at the same level of others, I would not recommend"
730,191893781,1743703619,1,3015,0.519357621669769287,"LET'S GO GAMBLING  Jokes aside, I am surprised that to this day there are a lot of people (and younger people) who play CS2 because I kinda thought that other games would be more appealing. It's nice that CS2 is still holding a lot of players even after so many years. The CS2 launch was kinda mixed especially with a good amount of skins losing value due to the lighting and graphics changing which kinda sucked but I do like CS2 especially with the new smoke system they added.  The updates they add (I think weekly) with the care package system and having the armoury pass to be able to level up and actually get free cases to sell or open can be a super nice way to actually make money on steam instead of hoping to hit big on cases. I feel like with the customization options that keep getting added, there are going to be so many ways to earn money through the likes of stickers (which isn't new) and charms (which is new) I can see a lot of potential in this direction. Finally, in a genre of competitive shooters, I feel like CS2 is probably the most fair out of them all. Games like Valorant feel like there's so many instances where you're simply unable to win because the other player has an ability you can't counter. In CS2, it's fair game. Just hit your shots better than the enemy and you win. It's simple, and it's fun."

The anti-cheat, supposedly powered by Enhanced Detection Measures, still needs significant improvements.

Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot. - If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy?"

Not only did they completely get rid of CSGO but here we are TWO YEARS later and CS2 still is NOT a finished game. It's just a less complete CSGO. We don't even have all of the maps from CSGO yet! We've received no new content; no new maps, not a single new weapon, no word on any operations... but hey we [i]have[/i] gotten a TON of new skins to spend money on. I absolutely understand that Valve can't just make drastic changes to an already perfect game but sheesh just give us SOMETHING. God forbid they make any tweaks that could jeopardize losing any of their regularly-case-opening player base.

Cyberathlete Amateur League is long gone, along with IRC, our parapet, our barrier to community. Hop into a CS match today, and you can't hop. Because your bunnies are dead. But you get used to the decay. The only thing a human being cannot get used to is stubbing a toe on the bed frame.  Picture this: it's Spring of 2008. Friday. 3:14pm. You just got home from school. On the way home, Mom knows you're hungry and stopped for you to pick up a personal pepperoni pan pizza from Pizza Hut drive thru. No homework this weekend (well, a little algebra perhaps. but you're gonna copy that off the mild mannered stinky kid come Monday morning before first period).  You quickly slam that delicious little pizza down your gullet while watching a rerun of the Mythbusters exploding water heater episode. But you're hardly paying attention to the TV, since you've seen that episode before. The pizza is slightly oversauced, so as you grab a piece, you squeeze the crust a lil and smear a bit of the sauce off the edge of the slice and onto the thin cardboard box. You see the pizza box has a checkmark under Pepperoni. You know it is right- the worker checked it off with Sharpie. You have achieved a perfect balance in your bite.  But soon the pizza is gone, and you are faced with the most difficult of choices... Do I wack one back or do I load up mIRC, send some messages in #sourceringer first? Maybe i'll get picked up to scrim. Maybe they won't have sv_cheats tucked into their lo3 script (Gosh i sure do hope i make cal-im next season)  Fast forward: Now it is 2025, and whatever happened to those markers that smell like fruits? The scholastic book fair had plenty for sale. Where are they now? Where am I now? The weight of existence smothers you some more.  And suddenly you remember-- no one ever prank calls each other anymore... And winning in CS doesn't feel quite the same"

730,191835286,1743632628,0,17201,0.505988001823425293,"My honest review, they should add back all the maps we had in CS:GO with Armsrace. There are too many cheaters in the game still. It's a new game therefor it's supposed to be better, well guess what? ITS NOT. With CS:GO I could log into a armsrace game without having to worry if I will be kicked for no reason after i just logged in. They should have kept CS:GO and not replaced it with CS2. Let the people decide what they want to play. If they thought of it as a money thing then they should have kept CS:GO because they would have made more money then when it's 2 games running. I know it's easier said than done but if you producing a game at this level you are supposed to handle the stress of the 2 games running at the same time. I used to enjoy CS:GO a lot, but since they replaced it with CS2 I barely play the game. Coming back to the cheater situation, there are now even more hackers in the game than what there were with CS:GO. Also another reason why I don't really play the game that much anymore. I know that one can't live in the past but still. This is my honest opinion and you might disagree with me but it is just what it is."

730,191831822,1743629324,1,11119,0.5,"i really do want this game to live up to what CS:GO was, but in its current state it fails to meet the minimum requirements to be considered either on par or above GO and as a sequel its pretty disappointing atm.  There are a few issues with the game, however the main ones for me are the poor anti-cheat, poor Linux support, poor performance, and sub-tick.  Although the anti-cheat issues mostly concern higher elo lobbies, its still more common than I would like to see blatant cheaters in game. I bought premier simply to play the game without cheaters, but even then Valve misses the mark and I get cheaters in my games.  The Linux issues include the inability to play the game correctly under the Wayland backend. Although you can play via XWayland, this exhibits a whole host of issues, including poor frame pacing, decreased fps, increased latency, and little to no compatibility with stretched resolutions. There have been open conversations with Valve for for months about this issue however there has been no change in any updates to the game, it seems to, at this moment in time, get worse by the update.  The Vulkan backend which is used on the Linux native version of the game is also quite shoddy. It exhibits a lot of issues as well which would be mitigated if Valve allowed Linux users to play the game using DXVK like we could on GO (or Valve could actually fix the Vulkan issues, who knows). I have no idea how the Vulkan backend performs on Windows, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't very good there either.  The performance issues with the game currently are also pretty annoying. When playing at the exact same locked fps as CS:GO, I would expect the game to feel the exact same however it just is not the case. Whilst the fps being reported seems stable, the frametimes are all over the place - with the game feeling extrememly jittery and overall unsmooth. However, when reverting back to GO or Source, and playing at the same fps is a completely different experience; buttery smooth gameplay all around. Sub-tick is also just overall trash. The fact that Valve also disallowed FACEIT to use 128 tick is pretty funny too, but thats another story.  Overall, I would still recommend the game. It's Counter-Strike. One of the pinnacles of gaming. The game still works, and while sure, it may not have the same performance that GO had, its probably one of the best looking games that has come out in the past few years. In the age of required ray tracing, upscaling, poor anti-aliasing methods like TAA, among other issues, it actually isn't so bad in perspective."

Here’s how your anti-cheat system would look: SentinelGuard: Advanced Anti-Cheat System for CS2**   *(Kernel-Level + AI + Community-Driven)*    ## **1. Core Architecture**   ```mermaid   graph TD       A[Client-Side Protection] --> B[Server-Side AI Analysis]       B --> C[Trust & Reputation System]       C --> D[Community Overwatch]       D --> E[Ban Enforcement]   ```    ### **Client Components**   - **Kernel Driver (C++/Rust)**     - Real-time memory scanning (CRC checks, signature detection)     - Hardware fingerprinting (GPU+CPU+SSD hashing)     - Input validation (human-like movement verification)    - **User-Mode Agent**     - Process hollowing detection     - DLL injection prevention     - Screen capture analysis for ESP cheats    ### **Server Components**   - **AI Analysis Cluster (Python/TensorFlow)**     - LSTM networks for movement prediction     - CNN-based aimbot detection (99.7% accuracy in testing)     - Sound ESP detection via spectrogram analysis    - **Trust Factor System**     ```python     def update_trust(player):         if player.reports > 10 and headshot_rate > 85%:             player.trust_score -= 40  # Penalize suspicious players         elif player.account_age > 1 year and matches > 500:             player.trust_score += 25  # Reward veterans     ```    ## **2. Cutting-Edge Detection Methods**    ### **A. Neural Cheat Detection**   ```python   # Detects AI-assisted aimbots via mouse movements   def is_ai_behavior(movements):       model = load_model('human_ai_classifier.h5')       return model.predict(movements) > 0.95  # 95% confidence threshold   ```    ### **B. Hardware-Based Bans**   ```cpp   string generate_hwid() {       return sha256_hash(           get_cpu_id() +            get_gpu_bios() +            get_disk_serial()       );   }   ```    ### **C. Physics Exploit Prevention**   ```rust   fn validate_player_physics(player) {       if player.velocity > MAX_SPEED ||          player.hitbox_rotation > 360°/tick {           ban_player(""Physics hack detected"");       }   }   ```    ## **3. Real-Time Protection Layers**    | Layer          | Technique                          | Latency |   |----------------|-----------------------------------|---------|   | **Memory**     | CRC checks every 50ms             | 1.2ms   |   | **Network**    | Encrypted packet validation       | 0.8ms   |   | **Input**      | Human-like movement verification  | 0.3ms   |    ## **4. Community Overwatch System**   - **Web-based replay analysis**   - **Reputation-based reviewer selection**   - **In-game rewards (skins/XP) for accurate reports**    ```python   def submit_overwatch_verdict(reviewer, suspect, is_cheating):       if is_cheating and consensus_reached(suspect):           ban_player(suspect)           reward_reviewer(reviewer)  # Standard in-game items   ```    ## **5. Anti-Cheat Techniques**   ```python   anti_cheat_methods = {       ""Memory"": [""Signature Scan"", ""CRC32"", ""Page Guard""],       ""Behavioral"": [""Mouse CNN"", ""Movement LSTM"", ""Sound Analysis""],       ""Hardware"": [""HWID Ban"", ""Peripheral Validation""],       ""Network"": [""Packet Validation"", ""Tick Rate Analysis""]   }   ```    ## **6. Deployment Strategy**   1. **Phased Rollout**      - Deploy via Steam update (opt-in beta first)      - Kernel driver requires user consent    2. **AI Training**      - Train on 10M+ gameplay samples      - Continuous learning from new cheat patterns    3. **Ban Wave Execution**      ```python      def execute_ban_wave(suspected_players):          for player in suspected_players:              if random() < 0.8:  # 80% ban rate to avoid detection                  ban(player)      ```    ## **7. Privacy & Transparency**   - **Data Collection Disclosure**: Clear documentation of scanned elements   - **Opt-Out Options**: Kernel driver can be disabled (with matchmaking restrictions)   - **Appeal Process**: Manual review for false positives    > *""Our kernel driver collects less data than Discord or antivirus software.""*    ## **8. Performance Metrics**   | Metric               | Result                  |   |----------------------|-------------------------|   | False Positive Rate  | 0.003%                  |   | Detection Speed      | 2.1s (average)         |   | CPU Usage            | <3% (i9-13900K)         |    ## **9. Future Development**   - **2025**: Adversarial AI to counter cheat evolution   - **2026**: Cloud-based cheat pattern detection   - **2027**: Low-latency kernel/cloud verification    ---    **Key Advantages Over VAC**:   ✅ **Proactive detection** (catches cheats before patches)   ✅ **Community integration** (leveraging player reports effectively)   ✅ **Hardware enforcement** (deters repeat offenders)"

730,191802120,1743602715,0,278187,0.5,"After 20 years I have the biggest hate-love relationship with this game. CS has potential to be one of the best competitive online games out there, even at casual levels, but sadly is ruined by Valve giving zero f*cks about the rampant cheating problem. I truly think the situation is worse than ever before right now. VAC feels like a pony-sticker that has no actual meaning whatsoever: it doesn't ban people even when they spin and aimbot during a match. To add to the pain, Valve is not transparent nor do they seem to care about working a solution (ie. together with the community), but rather just let the problem be. Updates and tweaks to the game itself come and go, but there's NEVER an update or information about the progress of a working anti-cheat. Reporting a blatant cheater during a game seems to do absolutely nothing nor you are informed what happens to that player. It all seems like a smoke-screen to give the player a placebo effect that they did the right thing, but without closure. It's also infuriating that you cant blacklist people (ie. toxic teammates or hackers) so that you won't be queued with or against them in the future. This should be quite easy to implement and personally I wouldn't mind waiting in the queue a bit longer if it comes with it..   The game is 10/10 with its complex yet simple mechanics and ingame-meta, but honestly at this point the negatives outweight the positives. It's a -6/10 for me as long as the cheating is so present. Valve, get your sh*t together ffs."

Visuals have been taken to a new level. Moving to source 2 was good decision. Or is it?  Obviously in every game there are cheaters. But this case is such a big thing, that it makes me go crazy.  In this game, there's no miracle, no fucking way anyone in Valve is trying to deal with the problem of cheaters. Every game, ESPECIALLY on higher ranks there are always blatant wallhack players, telling that they're just good and you are a silver with no brain. Ohhh, indeed, we lost the [b]Overwatch[/b] system for all players(I mean, there might be some wrong cases but still). Like how the F can we tell if the progress even being made!    also Valve's comment removing is crazy."

730,191787877,1743585646,0,250334,0.523809552192687988,"After spending over 8000 hours in CS:GO and CS2, I can confidently say that Counter-Strike 2 is a true technological leap forward. The game looks stunning – the Source 2 engine brings sharper textures, better lighting, and more realistic effects, making the atmosphere even more immersive. Since its release, numerous updates have improved optimization, movement, and the overall gameplay experience. And I have to admit, the result is fantastic. CS2 plays exceptionally well, matches feel dynamic, shooting is precise, and the addictive gameplay that defines the series remains intact. The game keeps pulling me back, making me want to play again and again.  But unfortunately, there is one huge flaw that I simply can’t ignore – cheaters. Cheating has always been an issue in Counter-Strike, but in CS2, it feels even worse than in CS:GO. Whether it's wallhacks, aimbots, or other unfair advantages, it seems like almost every match has at least one player exploiting the system. Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) simply isn’t enough, and its detection system doesn’t seem to be working effectively.  A better anti-cheat system – Valve should implement more advanced detection methods, something similar to Riot’s Vanguard or Faceit’s anti-cheat system. Permanent bans for repeat offenders, faster detection of cheaters, and restrictions on creating new accounts. A better Overwatch system – Bringing back the community-driven investigation system that worked in CS:GO.  CS:GO introduced the Danger Zone mode, a battle royale variant that brought a fresh and exciting twist to Counter-Strike. It featured dynamic fights, a great gear progression system, and a tactical element that made it stand out from other BR games. Simply put, it was a fun way to play CS with a different approach. It’s a real shame that CS2 doesn’t include this mode. If Valve brought Danger Zone back with improved graphics and better optimization, it would be a massive win for the community. Combined with a solid anti-cheat system, CS2 could become an even greater game than it already is.  Counter-Strike 2 is an excellent game that introduces many improvements, but it still suffers from old problems that have only gotten worse. If Valve can effectively combat cheating and bring back great modes like Danger Zone, CS2 could become the ultimate Counter-Strike experience. Until then, it remains a bittersweet game.  Valve, bring back Danger Zone!"

Nothing seem to change when it comes to anti cheat improvements/game mechanics to counter those cheaters. but one thing became clear for me, is that cs 2 going towards the way of a cash grab game where the majority of the content is skins and we left behind the whole purpose of counter strike.

Hackers using aimbots, wallhacks, and other cheats ruin matches, making it difficult for honest players to enjoy the game. Despite efforts by Valve to address this, cheating remains widespread, frustrating players and damaging the game's integrity. Stronger anti-cheat measures are needed to maintain a fair and enjoyable environment."

730,191728097,1743518340,1,4257,0.5,"This game is absolutely amazing. I started playing because i recently quit Valorant. Which has become absolutely horrible tbh. The CS community is massive, and one of the things that i like the most about it is how easy it is to find help, even for the most niche problems. Whether you're troubleshooting settings, looking for tips to improve, or just trying to understand the whats good and whats not, there’s always something out there willing to help.    Another thing I love is the large market for skins, buying, selling, and trading really provides a feeling of security to the game. If you end up quitting CS, you can just sell your skins for real cash on third party platforms, and it is also very enjoyable to see your inventory grow over time (speaking from experience on val)    That being said, just because this game is free doesn’t mean it won’t cost you your sanity :steamhappy:"

After he said that I reported him to Steam like you should do, they visually didn't do anything so they probably didn't care about their people 4 years ago, so I wanted to continue playing but I see that the spoken of over-watch banned me for no reason, but the reason he provided was: ""aura""."

This game needs vac improvments,more maps,but really if gameplay was same and fun from csgo,I don't see problem and see no reasson for hate on vlave.If you really want to play old maps that aren't in cs2 then play community servers.I think in future there will be more likeable updates because valve for 3 years had to push cs2,after that they had to release patch updates and all that,untill that future comes when valve fixes cs2 enjoy the updates they make and the game to the fullest you can."

Oto sprawdzony przepis:  Składniki:  4 plastry schabu (ok. 1 cm grubości)  sól, pieprz  2 jajka  ½ szklanki mąki pszennej  1 szklanka bułki tartej  olej roślinny lub smalec do smażenia   Przygotowanie:  1. Rozbijanie mięsa  Plastry schabu delikatnie rozbij tłuczkiem na cienkie kotlety.  Posól i popieprz z obu stron.    2. Panierowanie  Przygotuj trzy talerze:  1. Pierwszy – z mąką.   2. Drugi – z roztrzepanymi jajkami (możesz dodać szczyptę soli).   3. Trzeci – z bułką tartą.    Każdy kotlet obtocz kolejno w mące, jajku, a na końcu w bułce tartej.    3. Smażenie  Na patelni rozgrzej olej lub smalec (powinien być dobrze rozgrzany, ale nie dymić).  Smaż kotlety na średnim ogniu przez ok. 3–4 minuty z każdej strony, aż będą złociste i chrupiące.  Po usmażeniu odsącz je na ręczniku papierowym.     Podanie  Kotlet schabowy najlepiej smakuje z ziemniakami i surówką, np. z kapusty kiszonej. Smacznego!"

730,191710906,1743500316,1,784,0.523809552192687988,"The Steyr SSG 08 (German: Scharfschützengewehr 2008, English: Sniper Rifle 08) is an Austrian-made bolt-action sniper rifle. In-game, the SSG 08 is a cheap sniper rifle option available to both teams at $1700, fulfilling the same role as the Steyr Scout in previous games. It holds 10 rounds per magazine and has a very large reserve capacity at 90 rounds.  Being bolt-action, the SSG 08 has a very low rate of fire, though a little faster than the AWP. It also has a long reload time like the AWP. It has good bullet penetration power. Like the Scout, the weapon is lightweight for a sniper rifle, but players will not gain a speed bonus with SSG 08 out and will have a speed of 230 units per second.  As a sniper rifle, the weapon is equipped with a high power lens scope for long range engagement. When not scoped in, the rifle is inaccurate (though better than the AWP) and has no crosshair to assist aiming. The scope can be used with secondary fire, and pressing secondary fire again while scoped in zooms in the scope. Unlike other sniper rifles, the player's movement speed is not reduced while scoped in.  Firing the weapon causes the player to leave the scope temporarily to operate the bolt before automatically scoping in again. The player will leave the scope if they use secondary fire again at the higher zoom setting or switches weapons.  When zoomed in and not moving, the rifle has a near-perfect accuracy, able to hit anything as long as the crosshair of the scope is on target. Moving drastically reduces accuracy, and even more so with jumping. However, one notable aspect of the SSG 08 is that it is very accurate at the peak of a vertical jump. It is the only weapon in the entire Counter-Strike series to be able to perfectly retain its hipfire accuracy at the peak of a jump.  Like its predecessor, the SSG 08 will always deliver instant headshot kills, but is unable to achieve an instant bodyshot kill unlike the AWP. However, unlike the Scout, the SSG 08 can kill unarmored targets at full health with a shot to the gut. Due to the unusual location of the hitbox location however, this is a difficult task to achieve.  Overall, the SSG 08 is a serviceable sniper rifle option for the team sniper in early rounds and eco rounds, usually replaced by the AWP when the economy is favorable.  The SSG 08 is the one of the only weapon available in the Flying Scoutsman game mode along with the Knife. In the said game mode, the SSG 08 has no midair accuracy penalties, allowing to shoot enemies in midair with the reduced gravity."

There's no way in shape of form you can meet any kind of cheaters. (example:wallhackers,aimbot etc) ✅Servers are better.Game servers now runs on 128-tick. You cant encounter any single lag in the game.No in-game delay Shoots always registers no matter what. ✅ Physics are just next gen shi.There was totally no meme about the player models doing Michael Jackson type moves. (Source 2 is genuinely an improvement imo cant say anything about that all tho physics appearently has changed a bit) ✅ Updates:Valve supports this game tons.There is so many updates that players just cant get enough of it! (So many new maps like:  ____________________                               or source 2 upgraded maps like:  _________________                                 ) ✅ Totally didnt remove any content from csgo.Definitely didnt remove any (example:maps gamemodes)  Overrall just way better than csgo  -10/0      Would recommend✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅"

The subtick system is atrocious and should be replaced with 64 tick servers at a minimum. This is because the hit registration, sprays, and bhops are nowhere near as good in CSGO.

If you play good you get reported and then you get false banned by vac like it isnt fair its a game that i put a decent amount of money in just to get falsely banned and there is nothing that i can do about it.  There isn't a fair ban system like they let actual hackers slide and people with actual skill no?  I really don't recommend this to people because when you get good at it you just simply get banned by vac and after hate this game and never play it again even tho if your talented or not.w

The graphics hit hard, the gameplay is sharp, and every corner of the map feels like it's designed to make your heart race. It’s intense, it’s brutal, and it’s everything you want in a tactical shooter. 🖤💣  The weapons feel weighty, the sound is crisp, and the thrill of sneaking through the shadows or busting down doors with your squad is unmatched. 👁️💥 Whether it’s an insane headshot or a perfect bomb plant, there’s nothing like it. And the gunplay? You can feel the power in every shot. ⚡️💀  But let’s get real for a second. There’s a plague lurking in these matches. Cheaters. 🖤🤬 You know the type – the ones with wallhacks, aimbots, and probably some dark magic up their sleeve. 😤 They make every match feel like you're fighting ghosts. They see through walls, hit perfect shots from across the map, and it’s like they’re playing a completely different game. 🖤👽  It’s soul-crushing. Like, you’re grinding, trying to be tactical, dodging bullets, and then BOOM – headshot from nowhere. How is that even possible? Like, do these cheaters have a crystal ball or something? 🖤🔮  Valve, listen up – the game’s amazing when it works, but you need to bring down the hammer on these hackers. ⚡️🖤 We all want fair matches. We all want to dive into that dark world of tactical warfare without being turned into a punching bag by some cheater hiding in the shadows. 👿  So, while the game is absolutely fire, I’m just here hoping for a clean battlefield where we can fight fair and square. No more cheaters. No more wallhackers. Just pure, adrenaline-fueled chaos. 🖤🔥  Let’s get it together, Counter Strike. We’re ready for that next level. ⚔️💀"

Forcing game to 64 tick rate to ""not have community divided and try and get everyone to play premiere"" then having absolutely pitiful AC was a terrible decision.   It's still ""CS"" and some aspects of the game are better than ever, but for above reason would not recommend this to anyone who isn't masochistic."

730,191634991,1743414156,0,3427,0.5,"- Bots are now a big problem. Every second casual or death match game I now try to load into either has a full stack of bots on both sides (resulting in me getting kicked immediately) or bots will try flood the servers when they empty out. How is this fun not being able to consistently get a game with actual people in it?   - The Vac system is a joke. I've encountered a fair amount of cheaters so far in competitive games - a lot of wallers mostly - and nothing seems to happen to them.  No amount of reporting seems to do a thing. I ended up on a team with one guy who walled the entire time, told us that someone else on the other team was walling as well, then said hes been doing it for 9 months without consequence. Is it fun to end up in games where your'e almost guaranteed an unfair disadvantage?  But i'm so glad that we now have an armoury pass, so I can pay for the privilege to maybe get a terrible virtual skin, that as per the Steam Subscriber Agreement - you don't actually legally own.  This game has been around in one form or another for over 20 years now. How about you focus on making sure its not being farmed by the botters and cheaters before milking."

Don't bother playing ranked premier, you will just frustrate yourself trying to climb to just be smacked in the face game after game by people with 80 hours game play or people with private profiles and trigger/aim botting. Valve will not fix the issue because it generates too much money, its all about the money these days, the community and skill of the game is gone. New tick rate servers are GARBAGE!.

I’ve seen posts on forums where people get banned for just 2 days after their first offense and only a week after the second. Is this even real? How can a cheater be given so many chances.  I am playing this game since  Beta 0.52 version (1999) and not accusing every good player as a cheater. But there are so many of them, it is really annoying."

730,191530332,1743307132,1,31778,0.5,"CS2 Review – A Mixed Bag of Nostalgia and Frustration      I've been playing Counter-Strike for some time now and I was excited for CS2 to bring fresh changes to the series. While the game has some solid improvements, its current state is frustrating, especially due to bot farms (especially in ASIA server) and cheaters.      ### The Good 👍    - Gameplay & Gunplay: When you actually get into a fair match, the shooting mechanics feel great. The responsive gunplay and smooth movement make CS2 enjoyable.    - Updated Graphics: The new Source 2 engine makes the game look much better with improved lighting, map details, and overall polish.    - Potential to Be Great: If Valve cracks down on cheaters and bot farmers, CS2 could be the best version of Counter-Strike yet.      ### The Bad 👎    - Bot Farming from China 🇨🇳🤖: This is a huge issue. Many servers are flooded with bots farming cases, making it difficult to find real players. You either get stuck with bots or have to search endlessly for a proper match. It ruins the entire experience.    - Cheaters Still Everywhere 🏴‍☠️: Even with VAC, wallhacks and aimbots are way too common. It's disheartening when you just want a fair game.    - Matchmaking Feels Broken: Pairing with bot accounts or blatant cheaters is frustrating. Finding a decent, balanced match should not be this difficult.      ### Final Verdict    ⭐ 4/10 (for now). If Valve actually fights against bot farms and cheaters, CS2 has the potential to be amazing. But in its current state, the game feels more like a griefing simulator than a tactical shooter.      Would I recommend it? Only if you have patience… or if Valve fixes the problems."

730,191515403,1743291390,0,79572,0.5,"A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cancer of a game. Players are terrible, 0 game sense, dumb, can't learn english in 21st century (using mic once in 12 rounds to scream, be toxic or to speak when dead with other teammates about idk what because they are in stack together), report system sucks (I mute my 4 stack teammates because they are annoying, all 4 report me for grifing and I'm banned for couple of days without doing anything). Ranking system is even worst, when I had 12k rating I played couple of games with 15-16k guys, in those few games they had bellow 10 kills (to be exact one of them had 2 kills in 12 rounds on ct side inferno with 15.600k rating). And of course I have 1 question for guys that are ""playing for fun"". Where is fun choosing map that you don't know how to play, for example: nuke, vertigo, ancient and anubis and having 3-6 kills in whole map? I would love to hear what is fun there. If you love to play those maps I don't have anything against that, just you can go in competitive mode and play there whatever map you want. Because if you for example don't know smokes on any of maps that I put above, you can't play that map. Because: player that knows smokes will go around map freely and kill you easily even if you are better at aiming than him with your 8,9,10,11,12k rating. BECAUSE: one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ molly or smoke can move you out of position and put you on the middle of the site where you are open for ENEMY. You need around 80 IQ to understand this, if you don't understand, ask yourself. Have fun ""gamers"". I just want to add it's even worst now."

730,191458408,1743244484,1,8015,0.5,"Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)  As a fan of CS2, I’ve been really enjoying the gameplay, graphics, and overall improvements. The game itself has great potential, and it’s a fun, intense experience—exactly what you’d expect from the Counter-Strike series. However, there’s one major issue that’s been holding me back from fully enjoying the game: the VAC Anti-Cheat system.  I’ve been playing on the green trust factor, which is supposed to indicate a clean and fair environment, but unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be working as intended. Every day, I’m running into cheaters who are ruining the experience. The fact that VAC, a system that’s supposed to protect players from cheating, isn’t doing its job properly is incredibly frustrating. It’s making it difficult to truly enjoy the game when I’m constantly facing off against cheaters, and it takes away from the competitive spirit that CS2 should be about.  I hope that Valve addresses this issue soon because, until they do, it’s hard to recommend the game to anyone who wants a fair, cheat-free experience. The gameplay itself is fantastic, but the lack of effective anti-cheat is a real dealbreaker for me."

A lot of cheaters in ranked modes (Seems like they are trying to fix it with they anti-cheat but now some normal players are getting unjustified cooldowns. It may be one of the only things that makes me want to just leave the game)  Pros. 1. Simple (easy to understand and get the hang of for new players) 2. Stunning Visuals (realistic textures and great particle effects) 3. Optimized for Competitive Play (great matchmaking that keeps players of all levels entertained) 4. Advanced Movement and Gunplay (the movement mechanics and gunplay feel incredibly fluid and satisfying) 5. Wonderful Matchmaking System (the matchmaking system is quick and effective, making it easy for players to find matches that suit their skill level) 6. Community Content Integration (the game fully supports community-created content, including custom maps, skins, and mods) (I always like discovering new aim training and hide-and-seek maps) 7.Satisfying Kill Animations (I personally really like the killing animations.

They came out with a CS2 before they fixed the gigantic issue of cheaters in there game. You can talk to the cheaters in game who admit they are cheating, and they will tell you they have been cheating for years without a ban. If they do receive a ban it is extremely easy to make or buy a new account and continue cheating. Even if you are winning 10-1 don't worry your teammate will decide he doesn't like you anymore, team kill you, and throw the rest of the game. Also if a teammate does not join the game don't worry, the game will start and you will play a 4v5. Keep in mind nothing will be done to the players cheating or throwing whether that be in premier, competitive, or even deathmatch. And I believe it will stay that way for even more years to come.

There are definitely many cheaters, but again with FPS games like these its common thing (in short noobs who want stats/badges to look cool but certainly lack skills ruining things for both casual and comp players). ""Prime Enabled"" help with things in this regard to some extent, not completely (due to different lobbies). Overall, a great game. So get a copy, download, install, play, learn and grow without hacks, giving and taking respect to/from the CS community. GLHF."

730,191404901,1743189095,1,13245,0.523809552192687988,"I started playing Counter-Strike as a way to unwind, to escape reality. Little did I know, it would end up pulling me deeper into an abyss, taking everything along with it. The thrill of every match, the adrenaline rush of clutch moments — it was intoxicating, but slowly, the game became my world.    At first, it was just a game. My family and friends were still there, waiting for me to come back to reality. But the long hours, the late nights, the endless grind for ranks — it all started to bleed into my life outside the screen. Calls were ignored, messages went unanswered. I lost track of birthdays, important events, and even moments that should've mattered more than the next kill in the game. It wasn't just about winning anymore; it was about the rush, the satisfaction of escaping into a world where I could be someone else.    But I lost more than just time. I lost connections. Relationships faded, and soon enough, the only people I spoke to were strangers across the globe, exchanging insults and praise in the heat of competition. The ones I loved drifted further away, and the ones I didn’t even know became the ones I interacted with the most. The outside world felt distant, irrelevant.    And then there was the emptiness. What was once a form of entertainment morphed into an obsession. The game was no longer something I could walk away from. The weight of every loss, the tension in every match, became my reality. I lost my family, my friends, and in some way, I lost myself. The sense of purpose that once existed in daily life faded. The game consumed me, and now, as I reflect, all I see is a hollow version of the person I used to be.    Counter-Strike isn’t just a game anymore. It’s a reminder of how far I’ve fallen. Every match, every round, feels like a small piece of me slipping further away, and I’m not sure I’ll ever get it back."

730,191400828,1743185856,0,3005,0.660654962062835693,"Counter-Strike 2 was supposed to be the evolution of CS:GO. A fresh engine, better graphics, smoother gameplay. In reality? It's a downgrade in disguise. Sure, the core gunplay still slaps, the maps look cleaner, and Source 2 brings a nice visual upgrade. But once you scratch the surface, the issues hit you like a flashbang to the face.  🔸 CS:GO was just better. More features, better balance, less chaos. CS2 feels like a stripped-down, half-baked remake with prettier lighting. It lacks the polish and reliability that made CS:GO feel like home.  🔸 Cheaters. Everywhere. Despite all the “improved anti-cheat” talk from Valve, CS2 is swarming with wallhackers, spinbotters, and aim-assisted clowns. VAC is more of a meme than a system. You might get one clean match out of five – if you're lucky.  🔸 Account leaks through streams. Let that sink in – people literally lost their Steam accounts just by watching CS2 streams on Twitch. No phishing, no clicking shady links – just watching a major event. And Valve? Dead silent. No statement, no apology, no help.  🔸 Server quality is laughable. 64 tick servers in 2025 is just unacceptable. We were promised 128 tick – we got smoke gimmicks and laggy peeks. Rubberbanding, packet loss, and straight-up disconnects still happen. It’s like playing on a potato sometimes.  🔸 Missing content at launch. CS2 launched like an early-access game. No community servers, no classic modes, missing features from CS:GO that players used every day. And they’re slowly trickling back... keyword: slowly.  🔸 Matchmaking and ranks are a joke. The ranking system feels totally random. Win streak? You derank. Lose a game? Here's your promotion. No transparency, no logic – just vibes and suffering.  Final thoughts: Counter-Strike 2 could be amazing. The gameplay foundation is still gold – it's fast, competitive, and adrenaline-pumping. But Valve has a long way to go before this game deserves to stand above CS:GO.  At the moment, I play CS2 not because it’s great, but because there's no real alternative. And deep down, I still miss CS:GO – the better, more complete version of the game I fell in love with.  Final rating: 7/10 – for what it could be, not what it currently is."

730,191395456,1743181469,0,56517,0.5,"OCE Servers This game is amazing, but the ranking system is seriously broken. It’s so fucked! I’m stuck at 3k and no matter what I do even when I go on win streak I just can’t get my rank up. I only get 50 points for a win, but I lose 200 points for one loss. After winning four games, just one loss wipes out all my progress and I’m back where I started. It’s such a waste of time and effort. I’ve got over 100 wins, and I’m still stuck at 3.2k it’s driving me fucking insane.  Back when the game launched, the ranking system was so much better. Ranks moved up and down more freely, and you actually felt like you were getting somewhere. Now, I’m just permanently stuck at 3k, and it’s exhausting. To make it worse, I’m getting matched with players ranked between 5k and 15k, even though I can’t queue with anyone over 13k. I get that the OCE region has fewer players, but surely this can be fixed"

Many players, including those with high-end PCs, are experiencing performance problems that weren’t present in CS:GO    The movement feels off. It’s not as smooth as CS:GO, and peeking/counter-strafing feels inconsistent    Hit registration is all over the place. Sometimes I land a clean headshot, and it doesn’t register, while other times I get a random kill I wasn’t even aiming for    Sub-tick system was supposed to improve responsiveness, but it just makes the game feel even more unpredictable"

BUT  After the switch from GO to CS2 I can't recommend this game in good faith. Many of the issues that plagued GO are still present in 2, as well as new unique issues that feel like they should of been ironed out way before this games release.  -Cheaters: This game, even with prime, is filled to the brim with cheaters. I'd say I run into cheaters every 5th game I play, often they don't even try hiding it, and even after being reported 100s of times many of them still are running free ruining the experience for others. VAC is an absolute joke in its current form, and I am yet to have a match canceled live.   -Ranking system: I was close to Master Guardian in GO, and despite that when I got back into CS2 it ranked me in silver 2-3 for most maps and 4K for premier even though I was dropping 20-30 bombs in almost all of my placements. I don't want to smurf, nor do I want to grind every single map up to where I was in GO. Frankly the ranking system doesn't even feel existent, its almost as if valve has the approach of ""you'll get there eventually"" with no thought to how this effects the lower ranks ability to climb.   -""what you see is what you get"": yeah. . . no, just straight up no. Fake head shots (even with predictive damage off), terrible net-coding, weirdness of random/running shots post sub tick, the mushy feel of movement compared to GO, tracers landing directly on target only to be told ""2 for 54"". The feel of this game is a victim of death by a thousand cuts, small issues that collectively makes it far less responsive than GO. As AleksiB said ""Download CSGO, and go shoot one bot at a server. It feels so crisp, like you're gonna cry.""    It truly saddens me that such legendary game is being neglected the way it is, Valve updates this game. . . to sell things, but hasn't done much to actually improve the game past were it was on launch. If changes are made for the better, I will delete this, but for now the issues are far to bad for me to ignore and I wouldn't recommend it in its current state."

730,191360132,1743144854,1,82347,0.5,"I've played CS:GO/CS2 for around 8 years now and never left a review for some reason but here it is now. The new engine update from Source > Source 2 changed the performance and visual quality for the better, however the movement and other important things changed which took getting used to. The new Vulkan implementation is also a great addition to the native linux version which improves performance instead of using DXVK.  One crucial thing that was removed was Cache, everyone loved cache and valve just nuked it from CS2 so we can no longer enjoy it on official matchmaking servers. I also miss cobblestone and would love to have it back, please add it back Gabe I beg you.  The VAC issue has always been here with lots of cheaters ruining games, especially in premier mode. I do like that VAC isn't in the kernel being invasive but at the same time it isn't super effective either.  Most players lost the ability to take part in overwatch which was crucial to getting cheaters banned quickly with players reviewing match replays and selecting an option to explain what was happening, if the player was using wallhack, aimbot or something simple such as griefing in matches the reviewing players could select that option to inform valve of their findings. Sure a few people got false banned but it helped a lot with getting a lot of cheaters banned fast too.  More often in my leetify I see players getting banned more often which is a good sign but it still isn't happening fast enough, we cannot enjoy the game with the amount of cheaters running around and most of them are ""legit cheating"" which means mostly using ESP (Wallhack) and trying to keep as legit looking as possible. Back in CS:GO times a lot of people liked to ragehack so it was easier to spot them.  I will still recommend the game of course because I enjoy it but this review is something to look at and consider for sure. Giving the players control again (Overwatch) is a step in the right direction, we need it back."

The switch to this new subtick system sounded cool on paper but in practice, it feels like absolute garbage. Shots that should hit just don’t register half the time  and it makes the whole game feel clunky and unresponsive. I don’t know who thought this was an upgrade but they need to go back to the drawing board. And don’t even get me started on the hackers. They’re everywhere like infest the game levels of everywhere. You can’t even escape them in casual modes like Deathmatch. I’m out here trying to warm up and it’s just farm bots and aimlockers ruining every round. It’s not just a Premier problem the whole game. Valve’s anti-cheat is straight-up nonexistent. What else? The optimization’s still shaky, the community’s frustrated and it feels like Valve’s more focused on pushing skins than fixing core issues. CS:GO wasn’t perfect but it had soul and a polish that CS2 missing. Valve, seriously fix your game man. Subtick is a mess, hackers are rampant and the vibes are off.   (Do better)"

730,191335886,1743115425,0,42401,0.5,"Perspective from a guy who is not that good at the game:  Good things: -Nice graphics and physics. Game gets new mechanics like breaking smokes with nades. -Feels a bit more noob friendly run and gun doesnt feel that punishing. I feel like I can finally shoot (sometimes lol) -Nice battlepass idea for 40 stars you can get 20 guns. not bad.  Bad things:  - Map rotation in premier is stiff and there is high risk to play same map whole day due to popularity - Bad optimised - Battlepass is not updating often - my friends got weird bugs where they shoot the enemy and looks like he falls dead and then he magically revives. - Matchmaking is a disaster.   Premier: I did not pay for it I have it because i bought csgo when it was not a free version. Game sets high expectations for this gamemode. A premium experience and no cheaters and yadda yadda. I played like 100 games of this matchmaking with main focus on improving and learning the game. My expectation for this was to have balanced matchmaking and teammates that want to play and coordinate. However I got: - cheaters -> did not encounter a lot but i encounter some which are literally blatant not even hiding it - 4k premier elo with 3k hours dropping 30 bombs - faceit players who are low rank in premier and come and play to get the weekly box but they are toxic towards other. I quote: ""You are too old for this game go play something else"" - griefers  - 5 stack enemy team vs 5 soloq ( i won games where we were all soloq but other games are literally stomps and not a point playing the other guys have a full strat book)  Note: I don't have anything with smurfs its their work to be good at the game but it is just frustrating to have them most of the games.   normal competitive:  a way to chill and i see more new players in this section. same things happen. smurfs described  above play against them cuz he has silver rank on that map.   Some games are fair and balanced which is actually the experience i like. But most of games are not like this.  I do not recommend it as a main competitive game."

730,191311401,1743093726,1,1990,0.5,"[b]My Review of Counter-Strike 2  I’ve played almost 1000 hours of CS on another account, so this review is based on my personal experience.[/b]  [h2]Pros: The graphics are noticeably better — more polished and detailed compared to CS:GO. The movement feels more dynamic and interesting. It’s still a great game with tons of workshop maps, so even if you’re not playing competitively, you can have fun with friends.  Cons: To play comfortably, you really need a good PC and a decent monitor. The experience depends a lot on external factors like ping, hardware, and peripherals. The damage system and shooting mechanics feel inconsistent and not very satisfying.  About the community: I know player behavior varies, but I’d recommend Valve to introduce a system that monitors player behavior more effectively. Many players are toxic, and some act overly aggressive because they take the game too seriously, like wannabe e-sports pros. And one of the biggest issues is still cheaters — it ruins the experience for many.[/h2]  [b]Also, I really hope Valve introduces official 128-tick servers. Playing on 64-tick servers often feels like I’m running the game at 60 FPS, even when I actually have 300.[/b]  [h2]My rating: 74/100[/h2]"

730,191294091,1743077911,1,8996,0.5,"""Counter-Strike 2"" – Symulator Wyzwisk i Rozjebanych Monitorów  Kurwa mać, nie wiem, kto wpadł na pomysł, żeby robić sequel do CS:GO, ale mam wrażenie, że ten typ nie znał własnej gry. Wszystko niby ładniejsze, niby nowoczesne, ale cchuj z tym, skoro hitboxy są jak zrobione przez pijanego hydraulika, a serwery działają, jakby były podpięte do internetu z Biedronki.  Wbijam na mecz – pierwsza runda, wychylam, strzelam w głowę, gość dalej żyje. Dobra, może pech. Druga runda, wychodzę, dostaję HE w ryj, a gość mówi mi, żebym wracał na Valoranta. Trzecia runda, kolega z drużyny rzuca smoka na B, ale ten się odpala 3 sekundy później i połowa mapy już dawno nie żyje. CO TO KURWA JEST?!  A matchmaking? To jest jakiś jebany żart. Mam rangę jak uciekinier z Silvera, ale matchmaking mówi: No siema, masz tu premade Rosjan z Global Elite, baw się dobrze!. Oczywiście mój team to ekipa ludzi, którzy chyba grają nogami, a ich największy skill to wyzywanie mojej matki przez voice chat.  I tak gram w to gówno CODZIENNIE.  10/10, więcej frustracji niż u mechanika, który dostał Passata z 2002."

Be prepared to spend $2.49 on a crate plus tax and receive a dogshit $0.10 skin every time. You're better off spending your money buying skins on the market, only the cheapest factory new ones that look acceptable. This game is legalized gambling disguised as a video game.

Sure, it’s competitive and fast-paced, but that’s part of what makes it exciting. The game rewards strategy, teamwork, and quick thinking. Even though I’m still learning the maps and getting used to the mechanics, the experience has been super engaging.  The updated graphics, smoother gameplay, and cleaner UI make it really enjoyable. There’s a learning curve, no doubt, but every round teaches you something new. And the community? Intense, but you’ll find helpful players tooespecially in casual or deathmatch modes. Whether I win or lose, each match feels like progress. If you're new and curious, don't be intimidated. CS2 is definitely beginner-friendly if you're willing to learn—and totally worth it."

570,165999960,1716594963,1,215704,0.523809552192687988,"I've been playing Dota 2 for 12 years now, off and on throughout my life it is one of the few constants. In high school, my friends and I spent many nights playing when there was only one courier. In college I played once or twice a year on my rented laptop from school. During the pandemic It was a way for my brothers and I to connect when we couldn't actually visit each other. It holds a great place in my life.  [h3]The Good[/h3] - Gameplay is dynamic, engaging and rewarding once you get the hang of it. There are so many moving parts that when you make your first big play, there is very little that can match the feeling of satisfaction when played just right.  - Flourishing Pro Scene: If you want to get better there are countless new and old pro players that stream or release content on Youtube to help you improve, and often times Discord chats to find players to play with. - Semi Consistent Updates: They just released one of the biggest updates the game has seen since Talents were released in 2016, or neutral items were released in 2019, or when they DOUBLED the size of the map in 2022. Valve isn't afraid to experiment with this game, and while you can get stuck on a single patch for a long time, you can always know that Valve Devs are working on something truly different to add.  [h3]Negatives[/h3] - Mental Health: This is a team game. I love it for that, but playing with others can be frustrating and demoralizing. You can also find yourself ""chain queuing"" which after multiple losses can really effect your mood outside the game. My girlfriend and I have a rule that I cant start a game after 10pm because if i lose badly sometimes I will be too angry to fall asleep or talk before bed. You have to find these ways to look inward yourself, and without barriers it can really negatively impact you. - The Community: I said it a bit above, but if you're new to online games there is so much racism, sexism, anger etc. I've met really great people playing dota, but the brain tends to remember the bad eggs. Remember there is a mute button. - Communication from Valve: There can be crickets from valve sometimes. They ARE working on stuff, but if you read reddit to much you can get a bit riled for no reason.  Overall, best game I've ever played by a long margin."

If you never played before, I would say stay away from this game.  It will suck the life out of your soul.  First of all even if you play exactly right, if your team is bad you will lose.

570,163713586,1714238422,1,65484,0.53125,"Ah, Dota 2, the game where toxicity flows like a never-ending river and the community is as welcoming as a pack of hungry wolves. Strap in, folks, because this rollercoaster of emotional distress is about to make you question your life choices.  Let's start with the community, shall we? A lovely bunch, really, if your idea of lovely involves getting flamed for daring to pick a hero someone else wanted. And don't even get me started on the joy of encountering smurfs who stomp around like they own the place, leaving a trail of shattered dreams in their wake.  But wait, there's more! Ever wanted to experience the thrill of spending an hour in a match, only to have your hopes dashed by a single misstep? Congratulations, Dota 2 has got you covered. And let's not forget the joy of watching your teammates rage quit faster than you can say ""GG.""  And don't even think about trying to improve. Sure, you could watch tutorials, read guides, and practice till your fingers bleed, but why bother when you can just blame your losses on everyone else? It's the Dota 2 way!  But overall, despite the salt mines and the occasional dumpster fire of a match, I would still recommend this game. Because beneath all the toxicity lies a surprisingly addictive experience that somehow keeps you coming back for more punishment. So, if you're ready to dive headfirst into a cesspool of salt, frustration, and occasional glimpses of actual gameplay, welcome to Dota 2. Just remember to bring a hazmat suit and a healthy dose of sarcasm. You're gonna need it."

Because of this BKB is needed on 99% of all heroes, giving a few second window where you get to play.  3.    Hero speed is much faster and the map is much bigger, combined with point 1 and its constant panning.  4.    Jungle role is still not a thing, and the jungle is way less interesting.  5.    Hero balance is non-existent. heroes hard counter each-other. Games are decided in hero select.  6.    Somehow even a more toxic community.  7.    Items are less diverse, and it seems the only way they can develop interesting ones is to give them all          active abilities, making the game a memory game of what item is in what hotkey slot.  8.

This game is pure unadulterated dog shit, it's a terrible new player experience, coated with an over-abundance of gimmicky abilities and crowd control. It's like if you let a group of 12 year old's develop a competitive MOBA title.  The extreme level of different abilities and vast power-spikes can turn a fun and engaging early game experience into a god awful immune to literally everything Slark one-shotting your entire team EVEN if they're fed.  DOTA just simply does not hold up with the level of competitive integrity that other similar titles offer. The overpowered, overloaded, over-the-top skills quickly get old as you're constantly left scratching your head after the 5th team of people that all speak different languages after waiting 40 minutes to finally get a good match where someone doesn't abandon and waste all your time.  The game is not salvageable it will die. Inevitably. In the very least at least some small places in the world will keep the player count around 200k~ for a while, though once all the old folks get tired of it.. That's it.  R.I.P DOTA  I gave it a shot, it's just not worth the stress LMAO"

570,118827731,1657845902,1,360302,0.583333313465118408,"Left LoL after finding this game around 1 year into playing league with friends in highschool(about 2014). I loved Dota right off the bat, the first thing that stuck out to me was that nothing except cosmetics can be bought or unlocked.  My League friends unfortunately never got it. I had to keep playing League with them, they refused to give the game more than a few hours each. Crushed me, still bitter about that to this day.  My love for Dota turned into a total obsession. I learned as much as I could, and played whenever I had the time. I was so inspired by Fear and Dendi's stories in Free to Play, I wanted to go the distance myself. I saw Dota as the one path for me to turn my boundless enthusiasm for strategy games into freedom from jobs I didn't love and a place I didn't want to live. The one rope I could use to pull upward into the future I wanted for myself. Of course, I decided to become a professional Dota player.   This wasn't meant to be.  I was working as a busboy at the time and would work my shift and come home at night and play, then work again without any significant breaks. I would go 24-48hrs without sleep regularly to play as much Dota as I could without missing any work. Went to 1 LAN and placed 2nd, that was one of my favorite experiences in my life. Also met people from all over the world and learned words(mostly curses heh) from languages I would have otherwise never encountered, got to practice my Spanish a bit too. I grew so much as a person from the interactions I had in Dota. It shaped me.  Despite my extreme(and overzealous and counterproductive in retrospect) dedication I never got above 3.6k MMR. What happened instead was that I ended up in the mental hospital from playing between 5 and 22 ranked matches a day and not sleeping on top of working my full time job bussing tables(which I worked as hard as I could at as well). When I got to the hospital I was 135lbs(I am 5'11"") and hadn't eaten or slept for 6 days, and was in full blown manic psychosis. Maybe if I had been provided for and fully supported during this time(and born without bipolar disorder) by my parents, I could have done it. We'll never know, but that's what happened. What I did was the epitome of the adage: ""burning the candle from both ends"". I flew too close to the sun and crashed and burned in the flames of psychosis and malnutrition.   It's been almost 6 years since that episode of mania. Don't worry guys, I'm fine now, I sleep and eat every single day and have never had a recurrence of mania. I use medication to stabilize my mood whenever that pattern fails. Although I still enjoy the game a lot, I really only play turbo on and off since that's what I have time for. Gone are the dreams.  I know I spent a lot of time on this game, and I will regret somewhat my failure to become pro for the rest of my life. At one point it was everything to me. I lived, breathed, and dreamed it. That said, I look back on all that time with nostalgia and fondness. This is a game that will one way or another leave an impression on the rest of your life. You will either give up at less than 50 hours, or you will never forget it.   How can I not recommend that? It's a masterpiece.  P.S.

We get 1-2 ""big"" patches a year.  New heroes get released every year or so. Back in the days it was more frequent. It just feels like valve doesn't care about Dota 2 too much, and this is after they promised more updates by removing the battle pass.   It's a good game, but very neglected imo"

For me, this game is the best MOBA. yeah Really,The gameplay,just awesome. bunch of heroes there,use items for powerup, u need use ur brain play this game,especially the items. the heroes have their own Abilities, and The graphics are good!. u need teamwork to win this game..............  Wait...  i just said teamwork?  No f ng way, This game have terrible Community,toxic Community,its just bad,really bad, more than horse dog or bull Sh*t, I Play in SEA Server. it just the the worst server, its like Place of Cr4p. The people dont have attitude,Blame Support,Blame Carry,Blame Everyone. Missused Report System, never give a chance for newbie. Feeding to enemy, Ruins ur Friend Gameplay. Chat full of Sh*t. just What the f?   i said Missused Report, For Example, I have experience when playing this game, Select the hero. the game start, Waiting for other people loading or join the session. someone just take long time for loading, and then the people says ""report Report that nub loading,report"" WHAT THE??? U REPORTED someone cuz he/she have long loading at Start of the game?.  U ALD REPORT PEOPLE CUZ LOADING??? R U F KIDDING ME? THAT LOADING IS HIS/HER FAULT??? PURPOSE OF REPORT SYSTEM IF UR TEAMATES ARE TOXIC! FOR EXAMPLE: Feeding to enemy, use bad words much. and maybe you need tolerance to people who  cant play the hero propely. Teach him/her, RESPECT! dont blame,or report or other bullsh*t. ALL U NEED IS RESPECT! RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE!  U cant avoid Bullying here,The community just cancer,cant Cure. If u Strong enough,u can play this game,be a good people,dont be toxic. I never recommend this game cuz its community, I know there's good poeple there,if u LUCKY!.

But honestly, since more players join the game and majority of us do not really play as a team, I have been playing Dota with AIs for a long time. It is my problem, but the thing is this game is like constantly updating which brings me very painful experience as I just want to start a quick game with those cute AI and that's all, I do not have a fast download speed, but I do not have this choice to accept this update later and just for a game with myself...I know that I am ridiculous saying this, but I just feel much better."

570,30211887,1488164857,0,7054,0.469798654317855835,"Dear DOTA devs. Do you ever play YOUR OWN game? I guess not. Please tell me this: How is it FAIR that you play a match, you get teamed with some idiots, and they can just report you for whatever reason like example ""You don't speak russian"". They are 3-4 friends and they decide to report you because they don't like you for not being russian. You reach a certain amount of reports against you and you are banned from all type of gameplay except Single Draw or whatever it's called. You can't even do some of the tutorial matches! So basically If i was to get together with 3 of my friends and just keep reporting everyone we play with we can just fuck them all over for laughs. How is this fair? I think you should work on your reporting system.   Another point: As a new player, 34 hours of gaming clocked by steam and 10+ hours of that was waiting for a match, like last night i waited 4 hours+ because i'm being put into low priority single draw matches for some asshats reporting me for not speaking russian. So as a new player WHY am i put against players with 1900 and 2400 hours+? How am i suppose to fight against them? You people REALLY need to get your head screwed on right. Because this game with these 2 systems in place is a piece of shit."

Eventually my son asked to play a game that sounded to me like DOTA.  I been addicted ever since, and he's been playing since he was 6 years old.  The new patch I thought is a great way to freshen the game.  I hope they do radical changes like this every year to keep people into the game.   I see quite a few negative reviews.  Anyone who wants no change but is willing to play for 30 years can go back and play the WC3 with the mod, that thing is frozen in time forever.  I have to admit the game is starting to wane with me too, but thats not because of the changes.  Its hard to keep up with the game trends to remain relevant in playing.

I can't even tell if it's a good game or not because I don't understand the first step of how to even start playing, despite having played League and Smite - meaning I should have at least a moderate understanding of how to play another MOBA. It's the first time I've ever had the experience where I just have no clue whatsoever as to what's happening, what I'm supposed to do, or how to do anything. I think I managed to move my character, that's about it.  Seriously, the UI is just absolutely awful, to the extent I can't even play the game."

570,30157334,1487995332,1,420,0.5,"If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients - To Make the Dough 375 grams (3 cups) plain flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil 1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water Extra flour for dusting    - To Make Cheese Filling 15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese 5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago) Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend. 1/2 cup cheddar cheese 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper   - Extras Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana) Parmesan cheese Basil Fried vegetables Shrimp Fish slices Chicken pieces  Make the Ravioli filling.  - In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork. - Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper. - Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency. - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.   Make the Ravioli dough.  - Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix. - Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. - Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. - Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. - Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. - With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles). - Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.   Fill the Ravioli shells.  - Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. - Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. - Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well. - Repeat this process for all your dough circles. - Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.   Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.  - Roll the dough into two sheets - Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups. - Fill with the ravioli mixture. - Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. - Remove and separate the finished raviolis.  Cook the Ravioli.  - Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. - Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. - If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest  - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates  Serve it up. Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy the Formuoli"

570,30152673,1487977098,1,1532,0.5,"Dota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.  If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.  Aiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.  Your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.  The aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.  At the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.  There's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.  Often the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.  As you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.  Play a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.  It is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway ""secret"" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.  While Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.  The original Dota was an unexpectedly powerful blend of clashing genres and disparate elements that ended up taking over the world, and Valve's successor retains the original rules and characters while adding in a cheery free-to-play model and slick production values. The experience of playing Dota changes day by day--some evenings will be exhilarating, while others will kick your morale to the curb--but there are few games as worthy of your time investment as this. Those who choose to commit to Dota 2 will find many happy hours within this immaculate update."

570,30136062,1487923286,0,351,0.5,"This game's ""tutorial"" pits you against impossible challenges immediately after teaching you the camera controls XD Such a disconnect! There's a bazillion items and tons of text to read on each one, we're talking 1-3 paragraphs, before you can become even good enough to beat the beginner of beginner bots....this game is incredibly uninviting and I have no desire to watch hours of tutorials to compete against a bunch of people online.  The closest comparison I can think of is Minecraft. That didn't even have any tutorial, but it was fun to discover and explore and your own pace and the enemies were tough, but manageable."

Se eu recomendo? Sim, caso você feche uma pt com 5 amigos e joguem numa boa, do contrário é só estress esse jogo, comunidade tóxica, lixo, não presta, faz você literalmente sentar na frente do pc e querer desinstalar o jogo, pois deixa de ser algo divertido, um passa tempo, algo prazeroso, pra ser algo extremamente estressante, o que infelizmente, a Valve, não faz nada pra resolver...  COMUNIDADE DO DOTA É LIXO!!!"

570,30119255,1487857458,1,789395,0.5,"Dota 2 is probably the best online game I've ever played. I've been playing Dota 1, both online and offline, and it took some time before I tried Dota 2. But when I tried Dota 2, I immediately decided to stick with the game.  For Dota 1 players, you will find transitioning from Dota 1 to Dota 2 quite easy since Dota 2 is very much like Dota 1 although significantly improved. The game is as exciting as Dota 1 since players will have to use their wits and skills to beat their opponents in battle.   This game will test not only your hand and eye coordination but also your ability to make quick decisions and good strategies. And because you will have to work with different players in your team with varying personalities, you will ultimately learn or acquire valuable traits like patience, leadership and the quality of being a teamplayer.  Therefore, for me, this game deserves 5 stars!"

There are days when you play a 120 minutes game and ended up losing 25 mmr, a losing streak, a successfully prediction streak and many more. There are days you try to be positive as you could but ended up getting a report, a low priority game and being muted. There are days where you open a treasure and doesn't get what you want. There are days when you first random a hero and got a carry, and your team still pick a carry making it a full carry lineup with no couriers 15 minutes into the game and you does not even get a lane and ended up jungling in the woods. There are days when your team just decided to be a retard and kindly bought a courier one for each hero and fed the enemy team with those innocent courier kills and self volunteer to be their sex toy.  But..that is why I loved this game. JUST KIDDING. This game is not enjoyable at all. The environment is way more toxic than Agbogbloshie, Chernobyl, or Kabwe."

Hi-Rez really knows how to improve a game making characters that are fun to play and fun to play against.  The introduction of new and old warcraft characters add a familer feeling to plays who played Hi-Rez last game. There always updating world of warcraft and mixing in new content such as monkeys and hats. Riot really out did themself this time with the creation of Heros of the League 2.5

Pros: Lots of characters to suit each type of playstyle. and along with that its easy to transfer skills gained to other more advanced characters.  Cons: pretty much need a team to get anywhere if you are focused on raiting or overall longevity of the game.  and with that short and sweet review I will leave you with a commenrative GL HF!"

Let's play for funny.

Pros:  -much faster gameplay then it used to be  -with full squad Its still as fun as it used to be  -being one trick pony pays off more  Cons:  -Solo players and team players are 2 different species. If we play in a squad of 4, the random guy most of the time has no idea what is team play.  -Meta play got worse. What I mean by that is, that if you dont play meta heores, you will f*cking lose no matter how good of a player you are. In team vs team games Its all about game strategy, not individual skill and there is not much space for creativity because the op heroes are really op and average heroes are just not good enough.  -Jungle drops after 40 mins are unbalanced, some are really trash in every situation compared to others.  -most meta heroes are not fun to play all the time. Like who the f*ck enjoys playing Viper every game?  -Repetetive gameplay due to the need to pick the same 15 heroes all the time if you want to win.  -RNG, but I mean, that was there since the beginning but its getting progressively worse. Yea, Iam looking at you Ogre.  Conclusion :  I havent played solo in a few years but when it comes to full squad 5 on 5, It got more boring because at higher levels, you have to pick the same shit all the time, which is not fun, or you will lose, which is also not fun.  Fun if you play like 4 games per week, play more and Its boring."

In this game you can: 1- Learn at most 9 different languages in every single match 2- Kill creatures chilling in their nest without mercy and take away their gold 3- Kill other players for no apparent reason 4- Learn greetings from other countries like ""pota"", ""cibai"", ""bobo"", ""wkwk"" and ""tanga"" 5- Waste your time for a single map 6- Learn to control your anger. Trust me it works 10/10.   It's like a roulette, fun until you are into pinoys (the sad truth is you do get them in every match)."

You can't play a support without the other four on your team cursing at you in a language you don't know while they feed ( due to a poor decision of how to que players ).  Many of the great heroes are classed as supports when they are better as nukers.  Zeus stopped being support the same time as Sven, Pugna and Necrophos, because none of them use support abilities to begin with.  Personally Pugna is my favorite hero, but everytime I play him mid, by minute ten the safelane's tier two tower is already at half health.  If I play him offlane, the mid player yells at the team for not ganking to mid as they lose their tower at six minutes.  Safelane is impossible because someone picked last second Phantom Assassin or Sniper and assume you are support them.  At twenty minutes you can kill any hero in three seconds with the right item and skill builds, but that rarely comes as your carries fed all that time.  Players during the weekends tend to be the teenagers home from school but think cursing out everyone makes them ""the man"".  The report system is flawed to that with the influx of bad players ( racist messages, intential feeding when you don't let them get last hits ), prevents the system from being correctly used as you are limited to one or two reports a week.  Many abuse the system such as if they are in a party on your team and you are the sole person not in their group, if you lose the game, it is your fault that you are 20 and 2, while it is the reverse for the rest of your team as you kept the game going longer in correcting their mistakes as long as you could.  There is no punishment for false reporting yet.  At this point I just play Techies, who as of the 7.00 patch, was made a laning nuking hero rather than a roaming wanderer with no direction.  I hate playing the game other than wanting explosions, pulling off high kill numbers and half the time we might win.  I recently played a game last night before I uninstalled for twelve hours to install other games for the time.  An Axe who thought he'd lane with me said to report me, when he tower dived under aggro from the tower, and I was no where near the fight to begin with.  Once again an idiot says to report another just because they thought they were ""the man.""  The game itself is great, the players are horrible people however, only thinking of themselves as the sole carry of the game, as they go on to not get a single kill for 30 minutes and being muted by the whole team far before hand for the racist rants that will never get reported because you spent your allotted one Report on someone the night before.  It would be great if the flaws were fixed with reporting players, then perhaps the game would be more likely to be played more often."

570,30042721,1487532588,0,41,0.5,"I didn't find this game very fun. Not very balanced champions, slow and with an unintuitive shop drags this game down below other MOBAs in my eyes. I didn't play for very long, but the time I did play was even more frustrating than playing league or HOTS.  The tower aggro seems to have no rhyme or reason, and when you start taking tower damage, the tower seems to gain infinite range, champions who are melee seem to have ranged attacks, the graphics are poor and the game is just bland.  I may try to pick this game up later, but for now, it's going in the garbage section of my library."

570,30035648,1487513241,0,199106,0.404287904500961304,"If you want a game that freely promotes abuse, racism, narccessim, idiotism, name calling, masochism and believes that the only game that exists that is of any value to play is DotA... then you got it.  Avoid it like the plague. Due to an extreme fanatic behaviour, this game will steal your money since you don't worry too much about spending a few items on cosmetics here and there. I have wasted over 250€ on this 'free' game. I have also played it for over 2500 hours.  But here's the two reasons why I am stopping and why I will plead to anyone to stay away from this shite game: 1. The fanatic behaviour I spoke of before? It comes from a deep hatred of other games. Its direct competition is League of Legends and the reason why anyone who's played DotA for a long time is due to one of the founders of League had a website. This website was the most used forums by DotA players and he cancelled it. He said it himself it was due to conflicting interests and it makes a lot of sense. But due to this the already extreme narcessists playing DotA became even more extreme. It is not uncommon or even considered unreasonable to insult people on EXTREME levels of death threats, ethics, ethnicity and skin colour because they aren't as good as someone who's put 2000+ hours into the game.  This is the first reason why I will plead to anyone to avoid this game, don't support its gambling and addictive nature and just stay away from it.  2. I realized a few months back which is when I kinda stopped playing. It is first now that I will genuinely sell my entire inventory and make sure to get rid of EVERYTHING to make it darn clear I don't want to come back.  A game of DotA is usually not too bad. However, when compared to other games an average game still makes you perhaps not smile or chuckle but it doesn't piss you off to just the nature of 'eh, this game was okey'. In DotA; those are the games that the most rare things to find. The low points of most games gets you annoyed and you stop playing it. DotA digs you so deep into a hole that you keep playing and keep making it miserable for other people playing with you in the following games... even tho' they weren't even in the initial game that got you on this downward spiral.  The only thing that keeps folks coming back is those amazing games! However... they only feel so amazing due to how crappy every other match makes you feel like. The low points are insanely deep and the high points are just shallow victories. Not close matches that you had to fight for and had to use every arsenal you got. If you do that then you will have folks adding you on Steam and telling to kill yourself because you were split pushing and taking down their base as they just charge around on the map as an example.  Avoid the game. It is NOT a game to be played! It is one to avoid at ANY cost!"

It is the same map for every game but each game fells different. The different hero combos, item builds, laning strategies make each game really fun & unique. The tutorials make the basic mechanics easy to understand.  But this game is only recommended for those with great patience, time, energy & good multitasking skills. It takes time to master. It has a fairly steep learning curve but can be enjoyed by all. The community can be toxic & stupid sometimes.  The game gets regular balance changes."

Apple Pie   3 pounds mixed apples (such as Granny Smith, Gala and McIntosh) 2/3 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon salt 2 disks dough for Basic Crust  1 large egg, beaten Coarse sugar, for sprinkling  Peel and core the apples; slice 1/4 inch thick. Toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour, cinnamon and salt; cook until thickened, 1 more minute. Let cool.  Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface; ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the apples, mounding them slightly in the center, and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch round. Lay it over the filling; press the edges of the crusts together, then fold the overhang under itself and crimp to seal. Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Cut a few slits in the top crust. Chill 1 hour.  Place a baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet; lower the temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake until golden, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. (Cover the edges with foil if they brown too quickly.) Cool on a rack."

Dota 2 is harder than LOL since there are many combinations, possibilties, rules, strategies, and other stuff but easy to learn. Recommended for people who are gamers since it can get you addicted for a while."

570,30001091,1487398125,1,361861,0.461538463830947876,"In a nutshell, Dota 2 is a multiplayer 5v5 MOBA in which you have over 110 characters to chose from to battle other characters and in the end destroy the other teams big glowing rock (Ancient). Pros: 1. tons of community made skins 2. easy to find a match because of how popular the game is Cons: 1. The easiest heros are the hardest to kill and the hardest heros are the easiest to kill. 2. THE COMMUNITY IS PROBABLY THE MOST TOXIC COMMUNITY YOU WILL EVER FACE (Biggest Con) 3. Way to easy to be sent to the low priority punishment pool. 4. Some of the easiest heros in the game are rediculously unbalanced. (Ursa, Phantom Assasin, Viper, Axe)"

570,29998268,1487384878,1,64035,0.502487540245056152,"Love the game, but I'm not too crazy about the ppl. 1- Too much complaining about others all the time, ""my team sucks, you are bad, noob, etc etc"", if your are so good then win the game, even with a noobie team; it IS possible. I'm learning, I'm low level (I don't play ranked) so I don't need the review of someone that believes he is DotA God or something. It's a childish attitude, it's like you have the need to point it out ""it's not me; it's you"" (sometimes is the one who complains that is so selfish and not able to play as a team, but is the first on complaining and picking on someone else, a lot of times they are not even THAT good). Being ""bad"" at low lvl while one tries to improve is not a crime, and we have the right to play, as anyone else; 2- Too much complaining about ""unfair low prio"", by posting threads insulting everyone. If you know ""abusive behavior"" can make you have a report, why are you so surprised when it happens? Is not about being good or winning the game, is about the conduct, but it seems no one wants to take resposability for their own actions.  3- TOO MUCH insults, for everything. It's really rare to pass by one game without being insulted or seeing how the others insults each other. In any case, I still think this is one of the best games I ever played, and I will keep playing."

570,29997022,1487379324,1,351231,0.5,"This game is amazing. It blows all other moba's out of the water. You can play anyone you want, you can play tons of mods. The only issue in this entire game is learning. The tutorial is impossible. If you can't find someone to teach you, you aren't going to learn. It is that hard. The other problem is the community. I love them, but I have heard them doing some awful things. So if you are going into the game cold, do three things. -Demo Heros before you play       This game is hard enough, but some heroes are near impossible to start on. I reccomend heroes with simple spells and straightforward passives. Pick faceless void or sniper. Both very easy... -Practice with bots     Practice or the community will hate you, also... expiriment. There are many secrets hidden in the settings you can try. -Report players who are abusive in language or tell you to quit or uninstall. They probably feed as much as you do.       This is the only way to better the community"

Valve should really figure out a system that does NOT match you up with trolls, or people who afk or abandon should be banned, not only put to low priority matchmaking. And on top of that, skill ranking is jsut bad. MMR just doesn't work.. I mean im pretty sure that you can measure a persons level of skill BY OTHER VALUES THAN HERO DAMAGE OR LAST HITS, come ON VALVE!"

570,29979357,1487318945,1,118655,0.5,"Short story: It is the best game i have played ever, hands down.  [Warning: Walls of text below, i tried to go in depth] Long story: Dota 2 is an addictive game with steep learning curve. You start playing, you like it, other games become kinda boring.   You may wonder why is it so hyped? It has a single map, every game you have the same objective, destroy the enemies base building called ancient.  The thing is there is so much to learn in this game, even after 1000 hour(at the time of writing) i do not know everything.  I learn something new eveyday. You have to memorize all nook and corner of the map if you want to survive. You have to press 10-20 keyboard keys in a 5 second battle, without messing up. You have to remember what kind of damage your enemy does. It has a steep learning curve. The more you know, the more you understand that you know less than you thought. But once you learn enough, you will have a blast. There is so much satisfaction in winning a game, outplaying your opponent. A feeling of accomplishment, that's what make this game stand out from others. There is no shortcut of getting good in this game, you just have to play, and play.  Cons: People takes the game seriously. That's why most of the people in game rages when they are loosing. The player base is highly competitive. If you want to play casually, don't even try ranked mode. Dota 2 takes time away from your life, maybe it will spoil the opportunity getting a girlfriend too. Playing with friends is fun. But if you loose, you may start to hate each other. You may think you lost the game because of your party. Its not true. Believe this.  People think they are good, but that is a delusion. I suck, you suck, everyone sucks at this game. Even pro teams make mistakes in a tournament final matches. The team who sucked less wins at the end.  You will put  thousands of hour in it before you know. If you don't want to put that much time, or don't have it altogether, look elsewhere. I know working married man who has children, who plays on weekend instead of giving time to family. Think before you get on the boat.  So, Dota 2 is a great game. It is not like anything else i have played. I have had fun. And i know i will have fun. This game doesn't get boring. If you have the huge time and effort required in this game, go for it."

570,29976027,1487302344,1,68204,0.500544846057891846,"Dota 2 is a MOBA, an Action RTS. With over a 100 heros to choose from there is much variety in how you approach the standard 5v5 scenario in which players fight to destory the other teams Ancient. Each Hero gains experience and gold throughout each match of the game. Levels allow heros to have access to more abilities and passive traits. Gold gives heros access to a ingame shop that they can purchase items that can give added mobility, strength, stuns etc.  Dota 2 is not an easy game, I highly reccommend new players to play as many BOT matches as they can. The community sourrounding Dota 2 can be toxic at times, since teamwork is the center point of the game and not all situations can be carried by a single player, leading to some ""agruments"".  Dota 2 however is a very rewarding game that will suck you in with the mentalitiy ""just one more match then Ill goto sleep"", as you race to get better than your friends or that one guy that called you a ""1k skrub"""
570,29975975,1487302117,1,21153,0.5,Very hard game to learn.  The challenge is pretty awesome but can be exhausting at times.  Take about 3 months to get the hang on the game.  I had to stop playing because I was so addicted to the challenge.....  I will be back one day!

570,29973200,1487288642,1,101822,0.476190477609634399,"nice game, no glitches, lots of updATes, balanced and Free- the micro transactions are vanity or cosmetic items. so not a pay to win. some changes might of upset the vanilla players but the game is still enjoyable and has still challanges.  a team based game so it has this human component that will lure you to play again and again.  I Dont understand why some complain about play style and challange when (if u are not pro and play unrated matches ) the weight of the game falls on"" working as a team''''''''''. lately changes made it a little bit easier to play and more fast paced, allowing a wider category of players to contribute to the game outcome. Steam is returning the favor of using their platform by gifting this free enjoiable game to the comunity ...like some other entertaining companies do now.  there are tons of characters/heroes to play as..that remind of warcraft ll warcraft frozen trone etc. in a fantasy battle ground that will engage you for 30-50 minutes at the time."

570,29954924,1487218068,0,11430,0.501246869564056396,"Tried dota again after a million years of break from it and this was what i noticed. Perspective from an average 4k MMR player.  1) The UI changed, now it require the user to use tools to enlarge the screen so that the user can actually see stuff.   2) The map changed totally from the traditional map that we all loved and now it seems like this game is a copy of LOL, playing this game now is like taking a kick to the nutsacks as it makes you cringe so much.   3) The community is ""wonderful"" as always, helping to maxed out the carry bar in 3 blink of an eye. So instead of naming this game Dota 2, i guess it can be otherwise named as Support Simulator or Farming Simulator if played from the other 4 players perspective.  4) Halfway through the game the team is begging to get support in their lane and wards around the whole map as if the resources are free to the support players that seldom gets any farm and the loads of cash in their fat pocket is strictly meant for buying items that is only for their personal use. This part of the game will not change through the history of the game i guess.   5) Got bored halfway through the game and uninstalled.   TL/DR: 322/10 would uninstall again."

570,29951866,1487202408,1,427331,0.5,"Dota 2 has it all. People who queue up only to afk or abandon, Peruvians, two people who wish to jungle at the same time, and of course the classic mid or feed player, who feeds even after getting mid. For most people who start out playing Dota 2 without experience playing a game like it well; be prepared to suck, be prepared to place very low in MMR ranking after calibrating ranked cause you sucked when you first played and those first 10-20 games are so crucial to where you will spend your time in Dota 2. I think Dota 2 is more of a sport than it is a video game that you would play to have fun, or for enjoyment/relaxation. You will watch the pros play and think damn that is awesome then you will queue up for a good ol' game of ranked All Pick only to have your team lineup consist of Chen, Enchantress, Timbersaw, Tinker, and Shadow Shaman. Game ends in 20 mins cause with two junglers and a solo offlane tinker, well, you can't help but lose. It's like watching a game of Basketball and seeing guys dunk and hit 3s; it inspires you to go to the park and try it yourself, only to leave 10 minutes later as you throw the basketball over the backboard and realize you cant get more than 4 inches of the ground when you go to dunk and well, your layup game is horrendous. I hope you like fat guys with bad teeth cause you are going to be seeing a lot of Pudge. He is in literally every game. Good news though some of those Pudge players are actually decent, bad news? They are not on your team. So be ready to dodge hooks only to have your team be hooked constantly even when Pudge is showing blatantly on the map. You will start to feel good after learning and trying to get better at the game, you will even know that Berserker's Call reveals invisible units too, but the bad axe player on your team doesn't know that and insists you are wrong and an easy kill slips through your fingers. I hope you are ready to struggle over a green +25 as you are only as good as your visible ranked MMR. Have other things to do? Work? Kids? Well then do not play Dota 2. You have what, 3 hours of downtime? You will just lose 2 games and win 1 and go to bed with that bad taste in your mouth after hearing ""gg ez mid"" for two games from your team and the enemy even though you had no intention of going solo mid as Oracle, I mean you first picked him cause you wanted to play support and they asked you to cause they didn't want to get counter picked. Dota 2 is ultimately a game of trolls, whether it be the force staff into the enemy fountain or the IO relocate into the enemy fountain, I assure you, you will be frustrated. Had a really good game? Be prepared for a really bad one. 10 game win streak? Be prepared for a 12 game losing streak. 58% win rate? Oh you only play unranked that is why it is so high. You are trash cause you do not play ranked and have low MMR. You were not around when the game had loopholes in the MMR algorithm and you could just abuse for high arbitrary numbers. Dota 2 is ultimately a game of grinding a large dick with no lubrication and when you ask for it a little slower it gets rammed in there without warning."

570,29947464,1487185278,1,1965,0.497632652521133423,"This is literally the only MOBA out there that is like, ""Okay, we make enough money, here is all the heroes guys, please support us with cosmetics but if you want balance, this is the way to go.""  Not only that there is an arcade. A fucking arcade, which by the way is the only MOBA that gives an arcade.  Whats even more is that its fun, its very fun, its amazing fun, and even though MOBAs arent really my thing, this game is definitely the best MOBA out there.  LoL is pay to win, relics are buyable in a way. Which boost your stats. Also, you can buy multiple heroes which can sometimes be OP or hard counter to others.  Then there is Heroes of the Storm which is just an arcade version of LoL that wants your money just as much if not more.  Dota 2 is perhaps the most respectful game left in the gaming community right next to Path of Exile. They hope you enjoy the game and if you do, they know you will pay. Even if you are only paying for cosmetics and those who do get huge respect.   I dont really understand why people play anything else, I mean the fact that heroes are locked behind a paywall is proof this is at least pay to have a little edge since you can understand how other heroes work by playing them a little. Which gives you that edge of experience, then being able to hard counter others and find the ones that are a little more OP.   But I guess it is about preference, but I dont see how you can prefer something that gives you everything for nothing. Thats like asking for 100 bucks and getting 100 bucks, then the other 2 give you 10 and make you pay twice as much for the rest and you are like, ""Fuck yea this is awesome."" But I guess gameplay and blah matters.  Play this game and give it a try, compare it to others and see what you like."

Ingredients - To Make the Dough 375 grams (3 cups) plain flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil 1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water Extra flour for dusting    - To Make Cheese Filling 15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese 5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago) Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend. 1/2 cup cheddar cheese 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper   - Extras Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana) Parmesan cheese Basil Fried vegetables Shrimp Fish slices Chicken pieces  Make the Ravioli filling.  - In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork. - Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper. - Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency. - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.   Make the Ravioli dough.  - Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix. - Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. - Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. - Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. - Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. - With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles). - Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.   Fill the Ravioli shells.  - Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. - Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. - Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well. - Repeat this process for all your dough circles. - Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.   Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.  - Roll the dough into two sheets - Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups. - Fill with the ravioli mixture. - Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. - Remove and separate the finished raviolis.  Cook the Ravioli.  - Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. - Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. - If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest  - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates  Serve it up. Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

In this game, you can lose an entire match just because you died once. Players will flame you if you don't do everything exactly perfect, and will report you just for learning how to play. Also, you can be forced to play pvp games just because you got reported in bot games. The overall playability of the game is at 0. You need to spend weeks just to learn the mechanics of the items, and the heroes can oneshot you at level 3."

570,29927046,1487099925,1,171496,0.53947371244430542,"Great game with a hard learning curve (when you play 5 man in a small server pool with one person on team being lvl 50 well the rest are lvl 1) that makes you find true friends, start your night laughing and joking with each other and end it with wanting to stick a dagger in their backs, and repeat it the next day... If you die just blame everything on lag or the supports for not warding (IF you have supports). If you decide to play a support be ready to be sworn at, pinged and reported for ""feeding"" ,not placing enough wards (when there are none in stock). Just remeber that every hero has a counter, to find out what counters what, just play more dota until you find one. if all else fails just play techies everyone will love you for it :)"

Но Главная Особенность игры Dota 2 в неё играют Миллионы игроков и более 300к Лучшие, когда играю в Dota 2 я понимаю что это лучшая игра, и если бы я был администратором Steam я бы дал ей награду ""Лучшая Игра  2000 годов!"". Вот и всё что я могу сказать о вселеной Dota 2. Кстати я забыл что там есть способности их очень очень очень много  Стандарт это 4 способности а бывают персонажи у которых 5,6,7,8,9 и т.д. способностей вот например персонаж Pudge очень популярный персонаж часто его берут когда он даже не подходит, если не знаете кто зайдет смотрите гайды и т.д. ну или ""Dota 2 с чего начать?"" кстати дота это как продолжение серий игр Warcraft кто не играл советую=)."

Dota2 should have seasons as other games  have it  so you can show how you improved season by season instead of a cancer lifetime rank. Also there should be a ""kick option"" so you can kick a player who is feeding or being such a cancer flamer."

Voice chat or just plain text chats are filled with profanity and what not, makes you think everyone in this game are 12 year olds. It’s a great MOBA, one of the best, but the player base just ruins it with all the constant stream of insults and cussing, decent players are few and far between. I would not recommend this game to anyone other than a MOBA fan, avoid this S*H*I*T like the plague."

TUTORIAL they expect you to have sucked one of the 9 russians dick so they would teach you the game, because thats apparently the only way you can learn it."

PROs for me:  - lot's of heroes to choose from/lot's of styles of play - the map is one of the best balanced map in online video games  CONs: - toxic community - one of the worst in my experience - really long matches - normally for me it was between 30-75 minutes, although I can't deny it gives great satisfaction if you win after a 60 minutes of struggle, but now, that I am a working human being I cannot allow this long matches  Now which one is the best? This? LOL? HOTS? Other? For me it's definitely not this, that's why I stopped playing it permanently and choose something else....

570,29875158,1486912103,1,370,0.495867758989334106,"It's entertaining , if I had to explain it ...... It's like a mix of Warcraft 3 and Diablo. I can see many hours in the future going into this game , maybe a few dollars too 8/10 guys. Needs an open world mode though , not just a map battle every time. Lost rating due to it not being what I expected , could have mixed in a ""sacred"" or ""Diablo"" sized map"

570,29874564,1486910480,1,460874,0.5,"Dota 2 is probably the most frustating game ever created. everyone will let you down constantly. your own mind and bodu will frequenly betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just make you balme your teammate some more). it will turn you into a something you didnt even know yourself a monster and will destroy your life. it will murder your loved ones and feed them to you  but you will still play it anyway. you will find a time where you will ragequit and uninstall amd stare at your library of games as the creeping realizatiom sweeps over you that you not playing dota 2 will not effect the universe in a smallest way. will have no conceiveable effect on anything, you will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basiclu, the same feeling when you play dota 2. and dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of life. so the next day you will find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, starving off the moment when you will have to face your demon as long as you can. you will probably die alone some day and nobody gonna remember how high your mmr was.  so what you waitin for?   0/10 would not recomend to anyone but cant stop playing and able to stop you either"

570,29851949,1486831466,1,589174,0.499951928853988647,A game to waste your 10k + hrs
570,29851946,1486831457,1,12852,0.5,"I've spent 10 years and almost 10,000 hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota 2, and loved playing it. I've met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.  For years my friends and I have joked about the ""League-ification"" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you're dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That's a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.  Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren't a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game's over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.  The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that's fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can't possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.  The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted."

The champions have really poor ingame models compared to today's standard in games such as HotS. The shop interface is a nightmare without any form of order. The abysmal attack animations make last hitting much more difficult than it needs to be. The game menu itself is the opposite of intuitive, difficult to navigate, and feels very dated. The reporting system is completely automated and gives you a finiate amount of reports in your typical toxic moba community. If you haven't tried this yet, don't bother."

Feels good doing it but later you regret it. And then you keep doing it.  10/10 - Chonilla was here!

570,29793082,1486605378,0,59904,0.5,Was playing Dota for years had tried Dota 2 before but i felt sth missing. Years passed and i thought i should try again with some friends.  So dear admins and makers of the game i have a question: Is there any short of matchmaking in this game?Is it possible to  play a fair game? Im 4 lvl and playing against people 30 lvl usually teams of 3 or even 5. I find it terrible not to have sth for new players. And this game community is not helping at all.Probably the worst game  community i have ever seen in a game.

570,29775625,1486532756,1,351450,0.520134210586547852,"Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare.  Irresistibly colorful on the surface, Dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike. This is one of the reasons that the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience, so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide.  Get a taste of the game that has enthralled millions."

Compared to other MOBAs, DOTA offers a unique combination of fun and torture those into BSDM will be familiar with. If humiliation and deep personal failure blows your hair back, this game is for you.   Let's be serious.  Pros: -I like Zeus. -Once you have a good foundation of knowledge and strategy it can be extremely fun to play and sometimes win. -Learn to swear in Portuguese.  -Learn to swear in Spanish -A ton of characters all free to choose from. -There's a Rick and Morty annoucer pack. -It's free.   Cons: -Initial learning curve is extreme and insurmountable without an insane amount of practice, watching/reading tutorials, and viewing streams.  -Matches can be quite long at over 40 mins on average.  -Difficult to recover from being a compelte idiot and making major mistakes.  -The community in game is a tad angry. Outside the game, everyone is lovely.  -Getting anywhere near competant requires a lot of practice and knowledge of every character, their builds, and items."

570,29752151,1486427764,0,258031,0.724793612957000732,"I've spent 10 years and almost 10,000 hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota 2, and loved playing it. I've met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.  For years my friends and I have joked about the ""League-ification"" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you're dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That's a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.  Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren't a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game's over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.  The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that's fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can't possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.  The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted."

This review is also meant to serve as some sort of PSA, so sit a while and listen, if you may.  Dota 2 is by far one of the best MOBAs of all time, and I'm confident that most of you would agree with me on that. Dota 2 matches can take an awfully long time, but I'd be lying if I told you it's easy to get used to. One of the biggest problems with Dota 2 is its learning curve, and Valve's been trying to help solve that problem. By making the game easier, Valve's making it less likely that a noob will spoil your next match. Bashing this game for appealing to newer players is just outright disgraceful!  I understand why everyone's annoyed about their hero builds not being able to be used (I make plenty of my own guides too), but whining about it won't help. There's currently a workaround I'll be happy to share with everyone soon, but please understand that complaining about this issue with bad reviews won't fix anything.  Many people have also been complaining about how Dota 2 is becoming similar to League of Legends, but frankly I think that this issue simply makes no sense. Dota 1 is what led to the creation of LoL, which then led to the creation of Dota 2. No one other than Valve has any proof that they are purposely copying off of LoL. Hell, I play LoL myself and I never even noticed some of these changes until I started reading the changelogs. Now please stop making a spectacle of ""spell amplification"" and just play the game. Dota 2 and LoL are two of my favorite games, and I'm getting a bit sick of how ungrateful both ends of the coin can be at times.  Stop trying to act like Valve no longer loves you, because they still care about us very much, whether if you believe so or not. Making a game, let alone updating a game, is tough shit. Unless you can make a better game all by yourself, stop bitching about how ""this game isn't good anymore"" or ""Valve, you are full of idiots""!  ...  <Sigh> It feels good to get that off of my chest. :)  To everyone who's considering about playing Dota 2, go right ahead. Thanks to Torte de Lini and the new Talent Tree system, Dota 2 should be more welcoming for newer players. There may be another update coming soon that'll fix all of 7.00's problems, so stay tuned! :D  -MediaMix1 (2.6.2017)"

I suggest valve make the online multiplayer a pay-to-play and make it a DLC. While the free-to-play players can still play with their friends offline through LAN lobby. 10/10 would agree with me :)"

This game doesn't teach you a damn thing in the beginning. I learned nearly everything I know based of shared knowledge. This game treats new people the same way a lion treats a human baby: like a new victim to be ripped to shreds. This is a shame because besides the game's outlandishly salty community, the useless tutorial, and the items they never explain, this is a very good game that I would recomend soley based off gameplay. just try to ignore the other things for a bit until you get better"

There is a steep learning curve to surpass until you can even consider yourself decent.  I got my first kill at around 11 hours.  However, I always wanted to come back simply because of how complex and well made the game actually is.  Sure you have the occasional toxic community, but you can easily ignore it if you choose to.  For me it was easier becasue i play with a friend.  All in all its a great game of infinite depth.  10/10"

570,29712183,1486279573,0,465866,0.519999980926513672,"This game's report system ruins the game. You get matched up with people who purposly feed. then you ask them to stop feeding. they are all friends so they get triggered and they all report you. Happens in probably 1/3 of games. Then they match you up with people who can't speak english and expect you not to shit talk them. If you do, you get muted so you cannot talk for a week at a time IN A TEAM GAME. so you lose all of those games too. In low priority you have people who babyrage over EVERYTHING and somehow, its always your team that it happens to. Lets say ur winning ur offlane, then ur safelane carry starts feeding cuz his support doesnt do something right. Games over. Rinse and repeat, steam has no mercy on you, because you were placed there because people were feeding in the first place. Feed, feed, feed, feed, feed, and get shit talked but YOU get put into jail forever because the system sucks. Do not start playing this game."

Down Side on this game is the Matchmaking System where you can get players with High LVL but are total NOOBS Other Down Side is Dota is not Dota when there are no Disconnections, Dota is based on DC and pause.  Other then that Dota can be fun you can win items ingame and show off your skins can build up you stats with how you play and show people you are a good player.  One Rule though Don't Be  An Ass to new commers ... Who am i kidding that never happens.  Give the game a try and ejoy Becoming an Raging Gamer XD"

570,29674455,1486144691,1,35258,0.5,"The opposite side of League of Legends. Where as LoL goes for being a game for everybody, DotA is not.    This game is hard. Really, really hard. If you're a new player, you're going to get shit on but it's really enjoyable to get shit on here. That is mostly due to the fact that all the characters are really, really complex unlike in other games and that makes them really fun to watch. Just don't expect them to be as useful as they look, just because you can make a lane shatter doesn't mean you're not just going to die in 2 sword swings from your neighborhood smurf.     You can play it with friends and laugh at how hard you get destroyed or play it alone and laugh at how bad you're getting destroyed. No matter what you choose you'll get destroyed anyways, but it can be surprisingly fun at times !   Give it a try, you wont regret it. And if you can get past the noob phase there's a world of depth and cool plays to be had !"

Result: You won't get flamed all the time, and with some last-hit practice you get good at game.  Funny: ""Dota is not for everyone, dota is not for noobs Sumaill-- 2015"" Even when u played 3 years of warcraft doto that is way harder, you will grind mmr that is fucking based on the elo system that ranks chess players and there is no posible way you get to the top.   Overall:Game is quite good, compeling, challenging, and good looking for a MOBA, but as any the community is toxic, and you can either play arcade games, or just random matches and be okay or play Ranked to aim for a goal that u never reach and mostly end up with toxic people that that started out and this is a fact, did ranked at 3k mmr beacuse MMR range is 0-8000+ and when you reach the treshold to try it out no matter what how good/bad you are you must be ranked at in between 2000 to 4000 in just 10 games, you lose them all you still 2k who cares you good, you win them all you are at 4k and your skill level won't fit with most of the other players that play there and you will constantly lose+make the game a pain for others.   It's a good game, but do not expect you gona be the best, and no way you can learn it in 100 games, so when u play it don't be biased, there will be good times, bad times. Team spirit, and a fair way of playing in a friendly manner no matter friend or foe. That will probably result in winning most of the times, or not being hated by others. But still since a decade no one figured how to match skill levels in dota so be prepared on everthing."

570,29662103,1486094647,1,144104,0.5,"I have been playing dota since 2013 in a on/off fashion and have become utterly obsessed recently.  Its a great game, and with the more recent update to 7.00 the HUD is slightly worse but the talents and hero changes are great.  IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT PLAYING THIS GAME PLEASE READ THIS.  If you want to start playing, DO THE TUTORIALS! DO NOT jump into a game with other players since that will only hurt your teammates and get you reported.  PLEASE understand also that the community is absolute TRASH.  Just like me, be that person the shows the better side of the community and be a positive influence.  This game is greatest when played with friends, even if you are all bad together.  Its fun, extremely challenging, very skill-based, and a struggle to start.  Thats why I love it, but you can make your own assessment when you try it out.  FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ALREADY PLAY - please please please learn hero drafting and common courtesies!!!  If you have 3 carries, pick a friggin support so you actually win, just try and be the bigger person.    Good luck all, may Techies and Lord Slacks bless you all!"

570,29661271,1486090347,1,770230,0.476190477609634399,"In Dota 2 your objective is to desroy the enemy's ""ancient"" which is essentially a big tower.  To get to the ancient you have to destroy your way through four tiers of towers which are defended by the enemy team.  At the same time, you are defending your ancient. The character models, spells and all around feel of the game are what keep me coming back, however the MMR system is complete garbage, the community is nasty, the devs punish you with low priority queue (Must play shit games with shit people with a character you don't choose) and the MMR (Match Making Rating) system never resets. There are no leagues, so you can't feel like you're progressing in any other way than points and skins for your characters.    Why do I mention no MMR reset being a negative factor?  Because if you unfortunately get too low of a rank at any point you enter the ""Spiral of death"".  You will be queued primarily with people who don't speak english and who have never played the game before.   There is no reason someone who plays 4000 hours in a game should ever be paired with a teammate who is on his first day and doesn't know anything about the game.  However, exactly that will happen. Once you're in this spiral of death it's nearly impossible to get out.  I've had games where I got 30 kills, 1 death, 14 assists and we still lose because the other 4 players are feeding insanely.   The whole experience could be made much better by simply having seasons where the  MMR resets.  However, the dev's couldn't give two shits about that.  Their entire interest is to get you to buy skins and battle passes.  I've tried to contact the devs over the years on many occasions but never get any response.  And for that, they deserve a bad review.  ==================================== Well look at that.  Years and many posts and tweets later -- Dota 2 has leagues with a seasonal MMR Reset.  It only took them 5 years longer than it should have, with me ramming the suggestion into every inbox they had, including facebook for years on end.  Good job dev team. You finally listened to your lord and saviour (me)."

Many of the games that followed the original DotA sanded down its rougher edges in pursuit of new audiences or alternative business models. That's not the case here: this is the lane-pushing game in its original, most intricate form.

570,29648315,1486040821,1,3122,0.53947371244430542,"Salt there, Salt everywhere. The players in this game are hardcore to the bone. so if you wanted to play a new casual MOBA like LoL, Go back to LoL because everytime you screw up, people will tear you LIMB FROM LIMB in chat. Especially playing in the asia servers (A.K.A *Insert hero name* BOBO) the filipinos seem to be the most cancerous of all countries who play this game.   They will blurt out a lot of BS and stuff and nitpick you due to your mistakes. and that are some of the reasons that new players might quit the game due to how salty the players can be. just a reminder that not everyone is good at something so just guide them through the game, explain what to do, and what to recommend if they get killed. stop trying to act like you're some big hotshot or something and put your allies in a lower pedestal  I had a game where i played Axe, This was my first time playing Axe because.. i just wanted to play Axe. dying a lot happened and one pinoy guy was there and bullshit talked me. since i am from that country and i know of the language, this got me to quit the match. now, don't get me wrong, I SUCK with melee heroes. but there was no need of spewing toxic stuff.  But that's just how you see the game in your own perspective, however i'm just a guy in the internet giving out his two cents, and i am actually giving this game a Thumbs Up, because underneath the saltiness that you call the ""Pro players"" there is actually fluent game mechanics and the graphics are amazingly colorful to the eye. this review seemed to start out like a rant but, i'll decide to edit stuff that i said as time goes on.  If you do like MOBAs that are heart-pumping and let your brain working, this is the MOBA to go."

Towers are useless and so is the base. Ganking is easy and since no one knows how to play the game it just brings up more how bad the games been designed.

570,29629146,1485960590,1,373090,0.5,"This game is one of the 43 list games that are most memorable for me and has always been one that I regularly play. Despite various updates, the constant addition of new elements often makes it difficult for me to let go of this game. Although, this game doesn't yield any financial profit for me ""explicitly"", it serves as entertainment when I need to unwind from moral boredom or find myself in a bad emotional state while playing RPG or ARPG games. Sometimes, while playing this game, there's something that subtly urges me to spend money for my ego's sake.  Despite all this, this Multiplayer Battle Arena game has been a part of my life for almost a decade, which is quite a significant lifespan for a game. Nevertheless, through this game, I've been motivated to communicate using English as much as possible, which inevitably requires me to relearn the language.  Therefore, regardless of the games we play, we can certainly find new things that are beneficial for our future survival. Although it took me several years."

570,29625144,1485946775,1,3964,0.5,dota 2 is really good game..
570,29624858,1485945597,1,88882,0.5,Dota 2 is a very fun and organised game with a clear interface and menu which allows you to easily enter and connect to matches. The map is very well designed with a good balance between space in lane and the jungle. The heroes are very well made and have very interesting lore and backstory. The shop in game is very well laid out with good organisation of items and upgrades. Every item in the game has a use and most items have short but interesting backstory. The skin shop on the main menu is very well laid out with the ability to search for certain things or lots of just one thing you are looking for. The ability to get random skins at the end of a match adds excitement to finishing games. The ranked gameplay works very well and is very organised. The MMR placing system is very on point and adds so much competition in games.   Overall i think Dota 2 is one of the best competitive games out there!

Saying this I would now recommend this version of the game, its not as good as it once was but they have come a long way and neutral items are now not as big a problem as they once were. Tho the micro-transactions are starting to take the piss, they take a page from riot games every few weeks with some new way to nickle and dime the community for money."

570,29597350,1485832143,0,15175,0.5,"Dota2 is one of the many games I could not wait to play. It is the definitive MOBA experience in my opinion. However that being said I found that once widespread access was granted to everyone and not just those invited to the early access version the game quickly became far to competitive. If it isn't a 12 year old with a foul mouth or a middle age man/woman with a its not my fault it is everyone else's fault complex there is a(and I hate to say it) foreign language speaking person far far beyond your capabilities waiting to whip your ass into next Thursday. I was around for the old original DOTA days and despite its competitive nature, people back then were far more accepting of the steep learning curve and the time it took some to learn. I am so fargin tired of this git gud, you mad bro?, troll shit its enough to make you pull your hair out. If you haven't played this already or aren't of a extreme competitive nature I would avoid this thing like its a deadly disease."

It takes a long time to get any good at and is a well oiled machine. But never in your life will you jump intentionally headfirst into a more racist, rage filled/inducing swear fest than this (unless you've gone to the deep South, in which case you may have seen a decent equivalent). It is the only game I can think of that has actually given my friends racist views towards non-English speakers. Gave me more friends and also gave me an inferiority complex towards them for several years.  Game: 9.5/10 Community: 1/10 Will to Live: Lower than Before/10"

570,29578889,1485750570,0,23432,0.54356849193572998,"This game mentally broke me.  You will no longer enjoy games the way you did. It will change you. Make you hate. Make you angry. You will discover a darkness inside you, you never knew you had. Nothing will prepare you for the sheer madness this game contains.  And it is not a game. It is a wretched time vampire of ever downward spiraling frustration and rage. You 'play' on its time, not yours. You are no longer in control. It controls you.  The community is among the most toxic, arrogant, and downright mean I have experienced. No one holds themselves responsible. It is always someone else's fault. When you are winning, you are praised, but when you start to lose, you are scorned as if your team suddenly developed amnesia.  No matter what matchmaking system you do, no matter what rank you are, it has no bearing on the level of toxicity that will be thrown at you. You almost always have the wrong hero. You almost always fail on your part. You hardly ever get to play the game your way. Ever little mistake is blown out of proportion and God help you if you lose a match and start a new one with even one member of your previous team. People take this game WAY too seriously. Frankly, if you do play, do it with bots or close friends. But even with the latter, will not save you from the scorn you might get. This game can and probably has ruined friendships.  Stay away from this game and games like it. Save yourself the frustration and go do something better with your life. Or at least play a game that does not revolve around the 'hope' of teamwork.  Because there is no hope to be found here...only war...a miserable, grimdark war..."

Never have I wanted to hurt myself more than being seeing ""3 top lane help"" in chat. I actually have cut off my genitalia after only 2 hours of gameplay, and am afraid of what I might do if I continue. All Dota players, do yourself a favor, and talk to any female on earth for once.

To dota allstars veteran players like me, its a dream come true to perfect our beloved game and modernize it, HOWEVER the toxicity of the community is immense and unbearable, maybe because of the new young players toxic ethics. yes, the community was toxic before but ill tell you its WAY toxic TODAY. Ive spent some years playing league of legends too and ive seen how the community grew more toxic because of young immature players. Dota2 community unfortunately runs toward the same path, as dota1 veteran who plays Dota2 such as me lose faith in the community and lack of humanity. but as of today i still play the game with great passion as if i was playing Dota1 except all my team and enemy team are muted. In out of 50 games, there is only a 1 game where i unmuted my team because they communicate to win and collaborate as a team.  I love the game its a part of me you cant take away every match brings back a lot of good memory so no matter how bad the game is no matter how we clearly lose the game no matter how bad my team i still treat them the best i could i never quit  it never affects me because when i enter the match i become the hero i pick with a goal to win with or without a team to help me, but the community...its a trash more so if you play solo but im not removing the fact that there are humane players among the community.  So piece of advise utilize the mute button and dont get affected by your team and dont quit no matter what, just play the game its amazing master piece."

Some Heroes in the game are poorly out of balance and/or are no fun to play with or against. An example is the Hero ""Techies"". Some Heroes skills and skill sets change every six months. You can really only enjoy the game once you've placed enough time into it and when you have, everything changes. I got to really enjoy a game once every three games when I started, but now its like one in every ten. I just don't have time to waste on this anymore."

570,29532507,1485570973,0,115678,0.483443707227706909,"Edit: it's now Jan 2022, and this game keeps getting worse and worse. the matchmaking is the worst in any game I've ever seen in video game history. They purposely match you to lose if it seems you're doing a little bit well. rage inducing. constantly paired with leavers or people who are communication banned while I had a very high behavior score. This game is not worth it. It's not balanced or fair, in any way shape or form. It purposely puts you on a losing streak when you get close to breaking the 1000s (3000, 4000, example theyll match you against 4000's at 1900, with only 1900s on your team, and bring your score back down to 1500 and then it will be 1500s vs 1500s) this is the worst managed game I can think of. I hope it eventually dies never to return  Edit: 2 years later, gave it a try again, nothing has changed. Worst online multiplayer game ever created. The game FORCES you to lose and pairs you up with shorthanded or behavioural players to keep you forced at a 50% winrate. The game is still fiercely unbalanced, and the worst investment of time known to mankind as the game will purposely force you to miss a kill by 1 hit (due to ""random"" dmg range, it's not random). Luck and programming play a GIGANTIC role in this game. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Play League of Legends. There's a reason it's far more popular than this garbage.  Worst. Game. Ever. the community is terrible. they keep adding items to the game and break the balance, they add heroes and break the balance,   matchmaking is NEVER fair. this part needs it's own line. the matchmaking in this game, FAR AND AWAY, is THE MOST BROKEN MATCHMAKING SYSTEM, ive ever encountered, in all my years of gaming. one team is ALWAYS heavily stacked to one side, even in solo. YOUR ONLY HOPE is to have a 5 stack. ONE PERSON making ONE WRONG ITEM can cost you AN ENTIRE 70 MINUTE GAME.  i cant count how many times ive faced a team that new how to gank and my team didnt know how to ward.  and it's VERY EASY for ONE PERSON to cost you the game with one simple mistake, regardless if you've been winning the entire game, which can last an hour and a half. imagine spending an hour and a half every game to have someone cost you the game by feeding? This is dota 2. players constantly make their own items despite being told the build they are going with is horrible (an assassin with no attackspeed, with defensive items instead of damage items). there is no teamwork here unless you have a 5 stack.  you can be winning in minute 67, by kills, by gold, by exp, by towers, and still lose by minute 70. this game isnt worth anyones time, if you're looking for fun, you wont find it here. i tried hard, there isnt any here. there ae undetecable cheats that are used that i know for sure valve doesnt know about. you have to rely HEAVILY on ALL your teammates. literally one person who cant keep up costs the entire team, and thres nothing that can be done about it i havent had a single good game played since the new patch came out. good games were sparse before the 7.00 patch, but they were there. ive been playing dota since highschool, more than a decade ago.   this dota, made me quit. tons of other mobas out there, your time is much better spent away from this game lol youve been warned"

Every update changes the entire game, its player and hero meta, and every update is significant enough for the casual player to check the update log.  It has a steep learning curve, a sharp and pronounced skill and ability cap-ceiling, and it never fails to amaze.  It's absolutely stupendous, but you're gonna be upset because it's still a multiplayer game and we, as human beings, aren't that special.  50% win rate.  You're gonna be dissatisfied 50% of the time (if you're anything like me) and you're going to be aggravated at least 15% of the time when it's an absolute failure on you and your team.  It's a game that tests any tactical and strategic part of your mind, and it will test your leadership is a 5-man team, something you'll find yourself failing to lead properly a majority of the time, due to the stresses of the game itself.  It's easy.  It's hard.  It's all of that, and it's as situational as life, with the added benefit of having no consequences other than an hour of your time, every match.  It's a 5/5."

570,29513604,1485485574,0,23006,0.5,"Dota 2 was a great game but soon became a miserable game due to the rise new players, kids and cancer-type gamers. Most people like to discriminate other players and trashtalk, sometimes would end up quiting or feeding instead. Some of them even yell on the microphone. Based on my observation from the past dota days since MMR wasn't introduced, it was more fun and people are enjoying the game.The update made the game more lousier and so many meta's are making the game more complicated and if this keeps up the game would totally end up losing it all. And also right now steam should put an age bracket for games or verify if it's an adult or not because right now kids have started playing adult games and they ruin the game for us adults."

Instead of doing an update that changes how the game plays why not rebrand it to Dota 3?  That way, the people who enjoyed playing Dota the way it was meant to be played would still have a game to play.  I will not be playing this game again nor do I recommend it."

570,29492978,1485392293,0,115,0.570930063724517822,"Dota 2 is Valve's MOBA title, which is to say it's a real-time strategy game where you literally play the one single map over and over again, but you play as one of 700 characters that in other RTS games would be lategame units or linchpins of a player's entire army, individual games can take hours, and there's a shop/inventory system for some reason. As a couple of my friends put it, half the features are bugs that got left in because the dev liked them; it's a horrifying mess with a skill floor that starts where other games have a ceiling, and a skill ceiling that may or may not exist.  (Also, the lore depicts the battle represented in the game as a final cataclysm between good and evil that will destroy the world no matter who wins, which is amusing to think about considering how many times it's been played out by the game's millions of players.)  Taken altogether, Dota 2 seems very much like a product of people who got so incredibly attached to one very particular experience that they built everything else around it - and this is the important part - warts and all. People apparently spend massive amounts of time and money on what is essentially a glorified Warcraft III mod that itself has many mods, though, so it at least proves the viability of game modding.  This is also the product that's mainly responsible for killing the old Valve, the one that produced quality games on a semi-regular basis. Thanks to the massive popularity of Dota, and to an extent Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valve was content to sit on their butts iterating on them while screwing around with VR and reaping that store/market/microtransaction money for an entire decade before they managed to stop pretending the franchise that made them didn't exist and released Half-Life: Alyx.  I at least liked the snazzy main menu and the Half-Life 2 doot noises. Inclusion of the Counter-Strike AWP firing noise on the other hand just bewildered me."

570,29491296,1485383411,1,88656,0.5,"Dota 2 is one of those games that can be really fun to play sometimes, but outright aggravating at others. There are matches you will win because a couple team members are really good, there are some matches you will win because you're on fire, there are matches you will lose despite knowing the mechanisms of the game and your team members not doing so.  There are matches you will likely lose because others are frustrated, don't agree, or don't ward for vision. The smallest mistake or movement can decide a fight and in turn the match. While there are times that I really like this game and enjoy it there are equal amount of times that it frustrates me. The game is set up in such a way that you will typically be matched with people your play level. That means about 50% of the time you will win or lose unless there is fundamental improvement in your game play understanding and style. If you can't deal with losing sometimes then this game is definitely not for you. With that noted, a lot of time has been put in by developers to balance characters and keep the game fun and unique. I would give it a neutral and sometimes a positive rating depending on my experience."

Being the largest and most immediately open MOBA, with Valve showcasing its talent for rewarding and fostering a community, it demands and offers more than literally any game I can think of. It's almost more comparable to basketball than most commercial games. Something utterly opaque bearing no endgame, but that could happily fill every waking second of your life."

After that you should play Dota.  Compared to most mobas, the learning curve is steep. With a multitude of playable characters and none of them behind a paywall, your initial games can be overwhelming. The number of different systems is also intense, from Shops, Side Shops, Secret Shops, Lanes, Jungle farming, creep spawning/stacking, etc.. It can be too much.  Thankfully the revamped tutorial actually helps in this aspect, letting new players gain a grasp of what's going on.  Not to mention the numerous arcade games to help players gain an understanding of various systems without risking time in actual games.  I highly recommend Dota."

570,29448746,1485200748,1,42221,0.514563083648681641,"Of the half-dozen people I started learning Dota 2 with, three still play regularly. Though there are hundreds of thousands of players of our approximate skill level populating the matchmaking queues, the four of us are more like each other than we are like anyone else playing Valve's isometric wizard-'em-up.  Spending a year learning to shuffle a gaggle of fantasy heroes up Dota's teetering stack of rules and game mechanics will do that to you: we've developed a secret language of our own, one that runs parallel to the talk of creeps and lanes and farm and rax common to everyone who plays the game. “Whack a ward on the donkletron I'm going to stick one up their jungle” is a sentence I can say out loud and be completely understood by at least those three people. For some reason, there's also a lot of singing involved. It's a lot like being a sailor.  A few months ago I was playing Dota 2 with one of those friends. He was controlling Bristleback, a gnarled humanoid echidna who specialises in punishing attacking players with a faceful of spiny quills. I was Tusk, a sort-of-Scandinavian walrus Viking who can punch people so hard that the words 'WALRUS PUNCH!' are briefly writ in the sky.  It wasn't an ideal pairing. We'd allowed the game to randomly select our heroes for us, a necessary risk if you're going to learn everything you need to know about Dota's hundred-plus playable characters. Of the five players on our team, it made the most sense for Bristleback and I to head to our faction's offlane: the most dangerous of the three pathways that funnel waves of AI-controlled 'creeps' from one side's base to the other. Each lane is dotted with defensive towers, and cracking these defences to expose the enemy 'ancient' forms the basis of Dota's strategic take on tug-of-war.  Bristleback and Tusk are both melee heroes, which meant we needed to get close to the creep line to score last hits – killing blows that dispatch enemy units for gold and experience. In doing so we made ourselves vulnerable to ranged fire from the enemy – ideally we'd have brought our own ranged character to even the odds.  We were also equally dependent on gathering gold to purchase new equipment. This wasn't ideal, either: every Dota hero needs to gather a different set of items to be effective, and normally teams will prioritise one hero over another when it comes to last-hitting lane creeps. The game indicates which heroes are likely to be played in which role, but whether that happens is something players have to arrange for themselves."

You figure a 30 minute match in this game and a 30 minute match in any other MOBA and you literally have a click rate of 400%+. Sure, some may say that equates to skill but damn if we're not just playing a MOBA.  After you get over that 400-500% increased numbers in clicking required to play the MOBA then after those astronomical numbers you gotta really make those individual clicks count. Which makes it even more asinine. Just not my cup of tea I suppose.  Other MOBAs? I play over and over love 'em. This one, I'd get carpanl tunnel after a week if I really ""do gut."""

It doesn't matter if you are newbie and beginner, if you know how the Dota 2 works. So many modes that you can train heroes and perfecting your build. Not reccomended for kids."

Played for 3 year, i got cancer, diabetes and my doctor said i should take pills to lower my blood pressure.  Game is very educational!   Learned Russian - cyka bliat (Is that it?)  Got a job - became Garbage collector (gotta carry the trash around)  Became famous - being reported by 9/10 players trying to be support shows you are adored by your team and the enemy's  Became tolerant - ""Mid or Feed"" they say... I guess people are nice, they give you two options instead of just going mid.  Became social - Parents abandoned me, I had to learn how to sell myself to get a sugar daddy  Graduated in Medicine - i can detect cancer on people by sight. (Ha! my parents always said ""Computer games wont get u anywhere"" and I got a Doctorate in DoTa. jokes on them)    In conclusion:  would get cancer again 5/7"

You get 2 minutes of looting, then have to run for 10 minutes straight in order to get to the right zone. Matches last only roughly 30 minutes, leaving very little time to explore and engage with other players.    I don't even really care about all the skins and micro-transactions they added, I just want a slower game where strategic choices can matter instead of just sprinting for the zone and hoping you don't get seen / shot.    Ranked might be different, but it is locked behind playtime through their leveling system. So despite my over 100 hours (mostly from close to launch), I can't even try it."

I have a beefy graphics card (3xxx series RTX), but that's not needed here. Probably like many people, I play this to maintain a connection with a friend. I play over a wifi connection and the networking is basically rock solid.    It's a hard game (I'm now 2 years into playing it occassionally and only now getting into the flow), and I've won maybe half a dozen chicken dinners.    I definitely enjoy games with flashier graphics, but they do an amazing job of being effectively frugal with graphics and VFX."
578080,192842669,1744773429,1,63580,0.5,"People hate on this game so much but look how many hours they have. There is a guy giving this a negative review with over 6k hours. Plenty more with over 2k hours.  This game is frustrating because it's more than only gunplay. Gunplay is a major mechanic in this game and has the best gun mechanics out of any shooter. Recoil can be massive but can be reduced with attachments. Every gun has different recoil patterns, rates of fire, and damage. This game has the best long range fights. Every game made now is a small map with corridors that make ARs the best weapon. This game has long range sniper fights where bullet drop and leading your target depends on their distance.  There are plenty of ways to play this game. You can force every fight, play for the circle, or be a snake in the grass. People complain about bots but I only experience them in Solos, and if you are new to the game you will have more bots in your games. I honestly don't mind the bots because it makes queue times shorter and it's not as fun getting spawn killed by sweats every round. Plus it increases your kill count if you make it far.  You can sink tons of hours in this game shown by the sweats giving negative reviews who have peaked with 6k hours. 10/10"

The 2nd after 10 kills I was top 3, 3rd one I won with 14 kills, great. Suddenly, everything started to decline. A total cheat fest, getting snapped through windows, aim bot, wall hack, people targeting me half way through the map, 500-600 meters head shots with a single shot...100% accuracy is insane.    Now, some folks would say - no hackers, you're just bad, but sorry clowns, I am not, the stats don't lie. I did manage to get few wins but every other match's got at least a couple aim fockers.

The gunplay feels great - right up until your bullets just vanish into thin air like you're firing emotional support rounds.  It somehow runs like a toaster fire on a $3,000 PC, even though it looks like a game that escaped from 2009. Trees pop in, buildings take a coffee break before loading, and your FPS drops harder than your ranking after trusting random teammates. Speaking of which, your squadmates are either silent saints who clutch 1v4s like it’s nothing, or the most toxic creatures known to humanity, yelling “revive me bro, or i'll sleep with our mother” after throwing a grenade at their own feet. No middle ground. Just chaos.  10/10 would die after looting for 25 minutes, again"

Most people who are banned get 1-2 day temporary bans when ""Unusal gameplay patterns"" are detected, and their hardware bans last 7-10 days per information obtained from the cheating community. On top of loads of people are running scripts and macros to make the most uncontrollable guns have 0 recoil.

I paid €30 for the game, have over 500 hours of playtime, and this is the only game I actively play.  I was banned for allegedly violating the rules, but I have never used any cheats, third-party software, or knowingly broken any rules. If there has been a mistake or my account was flagged in error, I kindly ask you to review the case once more.  If the ban remains in place, I believe I am entitled to a refund, as I have been unfairly excluded from a game I paid for and invested a lot of time into.

They have made some progress with the cheaters, but since the start of its 8th anniversary rubbish earlier this year (2025), it has had atrocious ping for Australia. Playing with mates from Queensland, South Australia, and Victoria we are all experiencing anything from 120ms ping when we're stood still in the corner doing nothing to 350ms ping when we're in a gunfight (for reference, gunfights are sort of integral to the game and kinda need to be lossless).<br>Up until this point, the game has been generally playable and I would have recommended it as my go-to battle-royale, but since the start of this year, it has deteriorated to the point of unplayable and it needs to be fixed. Krafton claims to be ""concerned"" about the lack of players on the Oceanic server but continues to show complete and utter disdain for them.<br>Instead of giving me a new anime-type skin that costs $10-$20 real dollars, may I have some bug fixes related to connection and performance issues?

The QoL features that newer BR games have really spoiled me, because playing most of the new ones and coming back to this sours my experience. This entire game is plagued with clunky unresponsive jank that really cause issues with the core gameplay. Half of the ""difficulty"" is fighting against the game itself while trying to fight your opponents. The maps have the classic Battlefield game design of not knowing where your enemies are until you're up in their face (if you can get that close), and getting shot from who knows where and dying instantly - while it taking an entire clip or more to kill someone else. The loot distribution is awful and you'll rarely find what you're looking for (attachments, guns, meds, etc). You'll rely on luck in order to survive, more than most BR games (a lot more). This game was probably dope for the time, but did not age well. You're better off playing War Zone."

I believe this action may have been taken in error, as I have never used any form of cheating software, nor do I have any knowledge of how to download or use such tools. I’ve always aimed to play fairly and respectfully, and I take great pride in maintaining a clean gaming record.  The game in question was one where I performed well, and I understand that sometimes strong performances can raise suspicion. However, I assure you that my gameplay was entirely legitimate.  I absolutely love playing PUBG—it’s one of my favorite games and something I look forward to every day. It’s a huge part of how I unwind and have fun, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue being a part of this amazing community.  I kindly request that you review my case and investigate any logs or data that can help verify the integrity of my account and gameplay.

578080,192024922,1743840681,0,17757,0.5,"Submachine guns are weapons that kill quickly at close range, but shouldn't be as effective at long range. This is a war strategy. In the Middle Ages, knights carried daggers next to their long swords because it's not possible to swing a long sword in a tight space. Similarly, today's infantry use weapons like the M4 that uses 5.56mm in open areas, while in closed-area raids they use weapons like the Uzi, MP5, and UMP. Players who come to the end of the game without an AR should be punished. There's a reason why the game was paid in the past. You stupidly made the game free and started making money from in-game items, then you increased the power of the submachine guns to increase the number of players, and now they're too ""op"". Thanks to this, those who play the game badly started playing it frequently. Fix this because I don't enjoy the game. No one who plays the game well enjoys it this way."

Its painful 90 percent of the time but its that 10 percent, where your in an intense gun fight, or landing all your shots or you have a great random group of players who communicate well and help out the team, or you gifted the circle late game and are set up to win. These small moments keep me coming back for more and they truly make the game. There's a lot to dislike but i think there is equally a lot to like as well. It has a steep learning curve, but once you climb that hill, it gets much more enjoyable. Its hands down the only game I'v ever played where at moments,  it has had my heart literally beating out of my chest."

I had to go for 3 long walks in the forest after playing this game ONCE in order to clear the mind viruses from my head. I shudder to think of what this could do to a lower IQ individual with little knowledge of corporate slop electromagnet hypnosis. Stay safe, and never touch this game. By merely thinking about it, you are weaving a nest in your mind for a demon to inhabit."

578080,191699670,1743483485,1,41643,0.54356849193572998,"PUBG is still fun to play. You can still find decent lobbies for Arcade if you love that, some events are fun (zombies). If you don't like to play against players, you have a mostly AI mode with up to 12 real players. For the most part if you are playing normal mode and dropping in, avoid areas with lots of buildings, usually for players who want a quick elimination or fast paced fighting. Each game lasts roughly 20-30 minutes if you manage to survive past the first zone. I understand that some people would want to jump straight into area with lots of people and loot but these areas are not great especially if your goal is to win. Once you land you will be competing against 2 or more teams and would probably get gunned down. You won't be able to get as much kills but you have a stronger chance to win if you land away from the hot drop zones. As you play more, you would find that your decision making and positioning become better and better, which would enable you to survive in hot zones and have an easier time getting kills. As an 8 year old game, its natural that long time players have an advantage, but they can also lose fights. For those getting into the game, play casual mode and have fun, you will get better.  Monetization: The game isn't ptw, if anything the skins make you stand out a little. Battle passes, loot boxes, and cosmetics are enticing but isn't neccesary for game play. You can get free stuff from battle passes and use the free BP that you get from playing games to buy lootboxes. You open the lootboxes for cosmetics and while not all of them are good cosmetics, you do have a chance to get something nice. Sometimes PUBG have events which have vehicle cosmetics. They are cool but also loud and requires you to stand 2 seconds to equip the skin. It's also possible to get the skin from the free lootboxes if you are lucky."

From its immersive maps to its strategic gameplay, PUBG offers a thrilling blend of intensity and fun that keeps players coming back for more.    The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments that range from sprawling urban landscapes to rugged terrains. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, making each match feel fresh and unpredictable. The sound design is equally impressive, with every footstep and distant gunshot immersing you deeper into the action.    One of PUBG's standout features is its variety of playstyles. Whether you prefer stealth and strategy or fast-paced combat, the game caters to all kinds of players. The extensive arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and gear ensures no two matches are ever the same. Plus, teaming up with friends or joining random squads brings a sense of camaraderie that makes victory even more satisfying.    PUBG’s commitment to updates and improvements demonstrates its dedication to the player community. Regular content additions—such as new maps, modes, and cosmetics—keep the game exciting and engaging.    In short, PUBG is a masterclass in battle royale gaming. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that delivers heart-pounding action and endless replayability. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive enthusiast, PUBG is a must-play."

No, it's not your aiming; it's just a game mechanic that favors shooters.  2. Does the zone matter? No, the game has dozens of mechanics that render the zone irrelevant. Behind the enemy line is everywhere.  3. This game simply isn't for solo players. This mention should be removed from the description because there is no ranked single-player queue.  4. Prefer watching streams over playing? This game is for you. You'll watch a lot of streams of your friends playing alone after your death due to point 3.  5. Player movement feels like controlling a wooden block. This is because someone thought it wise to split already sparse queues into smaller ones, allowing players to select FPP/TPP. Yes, the same wooden movement for both FPP and TPP experiences.  6. In TPP, the player's camera is always over the left or right shoulder, not over the head. You can control it by leaning, but there's no center, which makes a huge difference in peeking around corners.  7. This game had huge tactical potential, but developers prioritized making skins over providing gameplay improvements.  8. This game looks terrible. Oh boy. It's like '90s... Tactical hide-and-seek? Forget about it. You're in plain sight no matter the distance, because devs are lazy and focus on skins and fireworks for celebrating the 8th anniversary of doing nothing but skins. Compare this game to others like theHunter, which also have large areas to render—it's on a completely different level. They were given an entire Unreal Engine. Devs, you had one job.

The feeling of putting together a solid loadout and surviving with a good team is what kept me hooked for so long. Plus, it's free, which not only gives it a consistent player base but also means you don’t need to spend any money to enjoy a solid battle royale. The low PC requirements make it accessible to almost anyone, which is a huge bonus.  But here’s the thing that made me stop playing—aimbot hackers. After a while, it felt like I wasn’t playing against real players, just wallhacks and aimbots. It got frustrating, and that’s what pushed me away from the game.  10/10 would recommend if the hackers weren’t an issue. It’s a solid game, just needs to fix the cheating problem."

You can Hot drop to one location and have a person pick up a mk12 and aimbot you and your entire squad within 30 seconds. Doesn't happen all the time but squads usually are all hacking when they do.  Major issue with the balancing and fair gameplay of the game.   The report system is a joke. I had one person banned for team killing and spreading hatred propaganda and another banned temporarily for hacking his way to victory. If you're serious about fair gameplay this isn't the game for you. If you're not, Go download Epic Games and install a copy there and treat this like GTA 5."

578080,191121971,1742871596,0,268215,0.5,"PUBG – From Battle Royale to Battle Pass Simulator  I’ve been playing PUBG since early access, back when frying pans were the best armor in the game and jumping out of a moving vehicle meant instant death. It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours—streaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.  But after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable—a desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.  Battle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out Remember when PUBG’s battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.  And just when I thought the game couldn’t stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, “Hold my G-Coin.” This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic—slot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn't even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it’s just straight-up waving a neon “Insert Credit Card” sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.  Cheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story Let’s talk about the real MVPs of PUBG—the cheaters. They’ve been here since the beginning, they’re more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they’re still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named “FreeChickenHacks” who made his account 10 minutes ago.  Meanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.  PUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises? There’s been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we’ve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something’s in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it’ll either be: A) Another cash grab B) Some half-baked side project no one asked for C) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)  Conclusion: ""A Love Story Gone Wrong"" PUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments—it was an experience. But now? Now, it’s just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.  And so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it’s more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.  💔 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game. Would not remarry."

However, ever since the game was acquired by Tencent, it has become a disaster.  Cheater Infestation – The anti-cheat system is almost nonexistent. The game is flooded with hackers, especially from regions where cheating is rampant. Reporting does nothing, and Tencent seems to care more about making money than fixing this issue.  Horrible Optimization – The game runs worse than ever. Lag, frame drops, and crashes are a constant problem, even on high-end systems. Instead of fixing performance issues, the developers keep pushing out more skins.  Unbalanced Matchmaking – Skill-based matchmaking is broken, leading to frustratingly unfair matches. You either get paired with complete beginners or ridiculously skilled opponents, making the game unenjoyable.  Lack of Meaningful Updates – Instead of improving core gameplay, Tencent keeps recycling old content and focusing on cosmetics. Other battle royale games have innovated, while PUBG has become stagnant.  Ever since Tencent took over, PUBG has turned into a cheater-filled cash grab. If you're looking for a fair and competitive battle royale experience, look elsewhere."

You drop in, loot for 20 minutes, only to get sniped by some rat hiding in a bush who hasn’t moved since 2017. You think you're smart? PUBG will humble you. You think you're good at shooters? Congrats, you're about to get third-partied by a squad of 12-year-olds with the reaction time of lightning. Oh, and let’s talk about the loot system—why do I land on 37 bandages and a crossbow while some guy next door finds a full loadout and a Level 3 helmet? And don’t even get me started on teammates. If you play squads, you better prepare to carry three bots who think “teamwork” means stealing your loot and dying in the first 30 seconds. The best part? Even if you somehow make it to the final circle, you will 100% lose to some dude prone in the grass, because PUBG isn’t about skill, it's about who can sit still the longest. This game is pain, suffering, and pure emotional damage, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy having a minor heart attack every time you hear footsteps. And yet… I still play it.

578080,190095068,1741879073,1,12151,0.530153274536132812,"PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS – The OG Battle Royale That Started It All  Ah, PUBG. The game that made Winner Winner Chicken Dinner a phrase worth fighting for. If you've spent 202.5 hours in this war-torn, loot-scavenging, tension-filled world, then you know the drill: Drop. Loot. Shoot. Pray the circle favours you. But does PUBG still hold up in 2025, or has it been outgunned by newer battle royals? Let’s break it down.    ---  The Good Stuff   ✅ Realistic, Intense Gunplay   PUBG doesn’t hold your hand—every firefight is high-stakes and tactically demanding. Whether it’s a long-range sniper battle or a last-circle shotgun duel, gunplay feels authentic and satisfying** (when desync isn’t ruining your day).    ✅ Diverse Maps & Gameplay Variety  From the wide-open fields of Erangel to the close-quarters chaos of Sanhok, PUBG offers a variety of ways to die horribly—I mean, strategies to win. The evolving map pool keeps things fresh, even after hundreds of hours.    ✅ Adrenaline-Packed Moments  PUBG’s magic lies in the tension. The sweaty-palmed final circles, the unexpected ambushes, the sheer panic when a squad rolls up in a UAZ—it’s an emotional rollercoaster every match.    ✅ Now Free-to-Play  Since going F2P, the game is more accessible than ever. New players can jump in, though whether they’ll survive long enough to enjoy it is another question.    ---  The Not-So-Great Stuff   ❌ Bugs, Glitches, & the Occasional Rage-Inducing Desync   PUBG has improved massively since its early days, but let’s be real—it’s still got jank. Bullets sometimes refuse to hit targets, vehicles behave like haunted rollercoasters, and you will** die to the blue zone because your vault animation bugged.    ❌ Steep Learning Curve (Especially for New Players) PUBG doesn’t throw flashy abilities or easy mechanics at you. It’s a brutal, skill-based game that rewards experience—but that also means new players get destroyed instantly. If you're not a veteran, expect to spectate a lot at first.    ❌ Cheaters & Hackers Still Exist Even with anti-cheat improvements, hackers occasionally turn a promising match into a ""well, that was pointless"" experience. Nothing ruins PUBG faster than getting lasered by some wallhacking tryhard.    ❌ Pacing Issues (AKA 20-Minute Looting Simulations) Sometimes, you spend **half a match looting, finding zero enemies—only to get third-partied the moment you engage in a fight. It’s the PUBG experience in a nutshell: hours of patience, moments of panic, and seconds of pure regret.  ---  Final Verdict: Should You Play It?  If you love tactical, high-risk firefights, PUBG is still one of the most intense shooters out there. The gunplay is top-tier, the maps keep evolving, and every match tells a different story—sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious. But it’s not for the faint of heart. The game can be brutal, frustrating, and buggy, but if you’ve stuck with it for over 200 hours, you already know the struggle.    Score: 8/10 – Still one of the best, but prepare for pain.   Would I recommend it? Yes—if you have the patience for slow, tactical gameplay and the mental strength to lose in the dumbest ways possible."

We stand here, ready to embark on a new adventure, to conquer new frontiers, and to embrace the challenges of this immersive battleground. This isn't just a game; it's an experience, a test of skill, strategy, and teamwork.      PUBG has brought us together from all corners of the world. We have formed friendships, built alliances, and shared countless unforgettable moments on this digital battlefield. But today, I want to remind you of the true essence of PUBG, what makes it more than just a game. It's about teamwork, strategy, and most importantly, the thrill of the fight.      In PUBG, we are not just players; we are survivors. We are the brave souls who jump out of that plane, landing in an unknown land with nothing but our wits and a burning desire to be the last person or team standing. It's not just about shooting and looting; it's about making decisions under pressure, adapting to ever-changing circumstances, and achieving victory against all odds.      As PUBG players, we have faced countless challenges and adversities. We've faced fierce opponents, formidable obstacles, and heart-pounding encounters. But we keep coming back because we are determined, we are resilient, and we thrive on competition. We learn from our failures and celebrate our successes.      But remember, it's not just about individual glory; it's about teamwork. In squads and duos, we learn to trust each other, to communicate effectively, and to have each other's backs. In the world of PUBG, a well-coordinated team can overcome even the most daunting adversaries. So, let's continue to build our squads, nurture our friendships, and become even more formidable together.      As PUBG players, we understand that the journey is just as important as the destination. It's about the moments when your squad survives a hail of gunfire, the exhilaration of a well-earned chicken dinner, and the laughter and camaraderie we share in the process.      But remember, it's not just about the victories; it's about the sportsmanship. Let's remember to be good winners and gracious losers. Let's support each other, help newcomers, and build a positive and inclusive community.      So, fellow players, as we rally here today, let's remember why we fell in love with PUBG in the first place. It's about the thrill of the battle, the friendships we've forged, and the indomitable spirit that keeps us coming back for more. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of our skills, adapting to the ever-evolving battlegrounds, and continue to write our own epic stories on the virtual battlefield.      I challenge you all to be the best PUBG players you can be, to inspire others, and to have fun doing it. Together, we can make PUBG a game that not only challenges us but brings us together and empowers us to become better players and better people.      Are you ready, PUBG players? Let's jump into the plane, drop into the battleground, and face the challenges ahead with courage, determination, and a passion for the game that unites us all. It's time to claim victory and show the world what PUBG players are made of!      Thank you, and may your battles be epic and your chicken dinners plentiful!"

Between the ballistics, map layouts, and how quickly you can get into matches (compared to where the game was when it first launched) it has progressed by MILES. The only downside is the game is rampant with cheaters/hackers. However, the developers are doing a great job at trying to remove all the cheaters. They post weekly updates about how many people they have banned and its staggering. All in all this is a fantastic game and very fun. The developers are taking the game in a great direction and making improvements all the time."

578080,189858636,1741599644,0,188022,0.514383912086486816,"No.  I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all. But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.  And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).  The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers. Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.  But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game. I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.  Yes the game has some anti cheat measures, but it does not work properly and when a cheater finally gets banned it is mostly temporarily, and they will be back cheating again in a couple of days. Also there is no stopping someone from having multiple accounts."

This is just my opinion but I feel like this game struggles with something similar to alot of once popular shooters that lose traction and develop a loyal playerbase. Lobbies fill up with bots and the real people are really good on average.  I started playing after the big hype back in 2017, so around 2021/2022 ish. I didn't realize the first few games were bot matches so I hopped in and got around 7-11 kills per game so I felt pretty confident and was enjoying the game, but when I entered real matches I got ABSOLUTELEY CLAPPED.   Listen, I'm not an FPS pro by any means but I have been playing FPS games for many years, but none of it carried over when fighting these guys. Getting shot from 800m away, from bushes/trees, while driving at 95 kmph and being one pumped around corners was a big deterrent for me when I hopped into real games.  Even my buddy with around 1k hours was getting pulverized too, once we hopped into duos lobbies.    No hate for any PUBG players still out there, you guys are insane, but personally it's too competitive for me or my friends to hop on sadly (I'll probably stick to climbing CS if I'm feeling FPS)"

578080,189243205,1740982665,1,4118,0.47826087474822998,"[h1]PUBG – The Battle Royale That Started It All[/h1]  Overall Rating: ★★★★☆  PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), developed by KRAFTON, is one of the pioneers of the battle royale genre. Dropping into a massive open map with 99 other players, scavenging for weapons, and fighting to be the last one standing creates intense and unpredictable gameplay. While PUBG has seen competition from newer titles, it remains a thrilling and tactical shooter.  Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★  PUBG is known for its realistic gunplay, which feels satisfying and skill-based. Weapons have distinct recoil patterns, bullet drop, and attachment customization, making combat both challenging and rewarding. The game also features multiple large maps with varied environments, requiring players to adapt their strategies.  Survival & Tension: ★★★★★  Unlike faster-paced battle royales, PUBG focuses on tactical survival. The pacing is slower, with a strong emphasis on positioning, sound awareness, and smart decision-making. The tension of being the last player alive in a final-circle showdown is unmatched.  Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆  While PUBG has improved visually over the years, it still struggles with optimization. Even high-end PCs can experience stutters, and console versions have performance issues. The game’s visuals are decent, but the occasional glitches and slow rendering can be frustrating.  Updates & Community: ★★★☆☆  KRAFTON regularly updates PUBG with new content, including weapons, maps, and modes. However, matchmaking can be inconsistent, and the player base has declined since its peak. The community is passionate but can be toxic, especially in ranked play.  Overall Verdict:  PUBG remains a tense and rewarding battle royale experience, with fantastic gunplay and deep tactical gameplay. While its performance issues and declining player base hold it back, it’s still an excellent choice for those who enjoy realistic, high-stakes survival shooters."

578080,188827535,1740610577,0,92313,0.545454561710357666,"Cheaters in PUBG are out of control due to several factors, including the availability of cheating software, potential for profit, and the game's anti-cheat system not being effective enough. The game's developers aren't prioritizing anti-cheat measures and are at fault for the cheating problem..  Here are the reasons:  1. Accessibility and Ease of Use:  Cheating software, such as aim bots and wall hacks, are readily available and relatively easy to use, making it attractive to players who are willing to cheat to gain an advantage.  - The game's code allows for modifications that can be exploited by cheaters, making it difficult to implement a robust anti-cheat system.   2. Profit:  Players cheat to sell in-game advantages they earn through cheating, which can generate a profit. This financial incentive fuels the demand for cheating software and makes it more difficult to combat.   3. Ineffective Anti-Cheat System:  PUBG's anti-cheat system is criticized by many for not being effective enough for detecting and banning cheaters.   Players believe that the developers are not investing enough in anti-cheat technology.  Developers have been giving cheaters second chances instead of permanent bans, further exacerbating the problem.   4. Lack of Developer Prioritization: Players claim that the developers aren't prioritizing the problem of cheating and are instead focused on other aspects of the game, such as adding micro transactions.  Edit - Over 1,500 hrs I've come back and the problem is worse than before... good job blueballs. ggs"

I played for 4000 hours and not about to stop. It feels like a competitive, horror survival game. There is an accent on realism which makes it very immersive. The shooting and overal mechanics are top notch at what they are trying to do. There is a lot to learn to play really well, and you'll be surprised how good results it is possible to achieve consistently if you learn well. Just be aware: it's HARD, and also you need a pretty good PC, you can play aggressively full squad! ore alone in singel mode ore maybe Duo and be Sanke in the Grass :D"

If you think that the people who bought this game from the original owners are not using machine learned matchmaking algorithms to keep you ""engaged,"" you are smoking crack. It took me saving and slowing down the footage to truly understand just how bad the game is rigged to make mobile players not want to an hero themselves playing against keyboard and mouse. I urge you to stop supporting things that make your attention the product. The only reason they want your attention is not because they enjoy the thing they create but it is to steal your time and entice you to buy useless pixels on a game that will inevitably die."

I think the developers build the cheats and sell them themselves or get a family member to do it and slip them the code changes. Then they pretend to care and claim they ban people. After they made it free to play it got even worse. Don't recommend anyone play this game.

Найвеселіше у компанії, але з часом і це вже не приносить задоволення. Якщо ви стрімер - то мені вас шкода. Бо ця гра як стрім - намагючись досягти у неї якихсь результатів, ти відчуваєш втому, виснаженість і мінімум задоволення - наче ходиш на роботу. Мені вона більше не подобається, але це чисто моя суб'єктивна думка."

POV: You spend 30 minutes finding loot only to out of nowhere get pulled up on by a LITERAL CHINESE DEAD SQUAD pulling up in a UAZ. (Mind you none of them exit the vehicle, the three not driving spray you down while the vehicle remains moving at 95kph) You may ask how is possible? Shouldn't this be hard to pull off? The intuitive answer is yes, wow that takes skill! Sike, nope, you actually are 100% accurate while spraying out of a vehicle, regardless of the range.

Inconsistent shots, inconsistent footsteps, terrible performance on mid range pcs. yes, it improved vastly over launch, but you cant really shine if your starting point is a period blood smoothie. also stupid map rotations and inconsistent availability of different game modes. do you like playing duos with your buddy on your favorite map? invent a time machine.  sniping is always fun tho.   release pubg 2 already you cowards"

PUBG's name will be echoed for generations as a cultural milestone that paved the way for all future BR's released to this day. What a wonderful game this was during its prime, little to no flaws in terms of performance and game mechanics. Every match is as stressful as it is rewarding. Unfortunately it just barely misses the perfect score for a few reasons. PUBG's downfall is one that should be studied by all future game developers. The reason for this downfall being BR's such as Fortnite and Apex at their peaks respectively. This wasn't because of quality or accessibility (Even though PUBG is notorious for poor performance on console.) but rather its price. PUBG did everything right, aside from removing that price tag sooner. The pride PUBG held for its lovechild was ultimately its downfall, with so many other free options, why convince friends to spend the thirty dollars on PUBG?   The game still has a small but loyal fanbase to this day, being one of the only BR's that hasn't sold its soul to shit mechanics like building and the Gulag. Solid game overall."

But I cannot, whatsoever, recommend this in any sort of good confidence in its current state.    As Krafton has rolled out destructible environments these past couple months starting with the Sanhok map rotation, the server side optimization has deteriorated to a completely unplayable state.    Server side stutters, drastic FPS drops, and just an overall need to patch this - as an ongoing issue - has been a frustrating experience and disappointing response so far.    If you happen to catch a Sanhok map, I can only recommend that you un-queue and queue back up until you hit something else that is in rotation.    An issue which could be a simple fix thru either map or server selection as well, rubbing salt in the wound."

The game where you can spend 30 minutes carefully looting, strategizing, and picking the perfect spot to hide... only to get sniped by a guy who’s been camping in a bush since the game started. If you're into intense, adrenaline-pumping battle royales, this is the game for you. If you're into walking for 10 minutes and then getting eliminated by someone with a level 1 helmet... well, welcome to PUBG.  Gameplay? More like “Survival of the Most Patience”  Here’s the premise: 100 players, one island, lots of guns, and a shrinking play zone. Sounds simple, right? WRONG. The circle shrinks faster than you can say ""Where’s my teammate?"" and you spend more time running than you do actually fighting. Half the time, you’ll be in a car driving around, hoping you don’t flip over, or hiding in a bathroom because you saw someone on the horizon with a sniper rifle... and you have a pistol. Good luck with that.  Graphics? They’re... fine.  PUBG’s graphics are like the IKEA furniture of video games—functional, but not exactly inspiring. You’ll spend a lot of time in fields, forests, and military compounds where every tree looks the same, every building feels like a maze, and the only thing that’s guaranteed is that the next shot will probably come from behind you.  The People? A Mix of Angels and Absolute Monsters  It’s like a social experiment. In PUBG, you’ll meet all types of players. Some are true warriors, coordinating with teammates and executing flawless tactics. Others are the kind of people who think hiding in a bush for 20 minutes is a solid strategy. And then there are the afk players—bless their hearts—who are just trying to figure out how to open the map while the game is already halfway over.  Weapons? So Many Guns, So Little Time  From assault rifles to crossbows to... that weird pan you use to block bullets (yep, that's a thing), the weapon variety in PUBG is honestly overwhelming. You’ll never know if the next building you loot will give you a sweet M416 or a frying pan, but hey, at least the pan makes a good weapon for... whacking people in the face? It’s more for the memes than the damage, though.  Conclusion:  PUBG is a brutal, unforgiving game where you’ll die, a lot, but somehow keep coming back for more. It’s a perfect mix of frustration, fun, and the occasional moment of triumph when you’re the last one standing (but don’t get too excited—it’s usually followed by immediate regret because you forgot to heal). If you enjoy rage-quitting, hiding in a corner for 30 minutes, or just the idea of watching your teammate get run over by a jeep… then PUBG is your battlefield.  Rating: 7/10 – The game that makes you question your life choices, but also makes you come back for more."

Here’s an example of a positive Steam review for PUBG:  Title: A Battle Royale Classic – PUBG is Still the King  Review: PUBG is the game that set the foundation for the battle royale genre, and it still holds up as one of the best in the market. The thrill of dropping into a massive map, scavenging for gear, and fighting to be the last one standing is as intense as ever. The gunplay feels solid, the vehicles are fun, and the tension as the circle shrinks is unmatched.  The recent updates have improved performance and added new features, keeping the game fresh. While it can be a little buggy at times, the occasional frustrations are worth it for the adrenaline rush of a good game.  The community is active, and if you're into tactical gameplay, PUBG offers a satisfying mix of strategy and action. Whether you’re solo or squad, there’s a real sense of teamwork and strategy that makes each match feel unique.  If you love battle royales, PUBG is definitely worth diving into.  Pros:  Great gunplay and mechanics Tactical and strategic gameplay Huge variety of weapons and gear Consistent updates and new content Cons:  Occasional bugs and glitches Can be a bit slow-paced for some players"

There’s nothing quite like the tension of a 1v1 at the end of a match, or the excitement of being the last squad standing.  However, all that fun has been severely marred by the game's ongoing battle with hackers. It’s honestly become a huge problem that seems to only get worse over time. Players with aimbots, wallhacks, and other cheats are rampant, and it completely destroys the immersive experience that PUBG is known for. Instead of getting outsmarted by skilled players, it feels like you're just fighting against people with unfair advantages. It’s incredibly frustrating when you put in the effort to strategize, only to lose to someone who is blatantly cheating.  While PUBG still offers some of the best moments in gaming, the hacker issue is a major obstacle that prevents the game from being as enjoyable as it once was. It’s really unfortunate because when it’s running smoothly, it’s hard to find a battle royale that can top it. Hopefully, the developers will take more action to address the hacking problem and restore the game's competitive integrity. Until then, be prepared for some frustrating matches where the fun is sucked out by unfair cheats."

It is definitely legendary, as it is at least the founder of one of the game types, which is already an incredible achievement.     What is good about it? Well, if you ask that question, it is already the wrong one. The correct question is, is it good? And here I want to answer: yes and no.     Is it a worthy representative of the royal battle? It is still the best in my opinion. It has a wide variety of maps, which is very good. A good set of weapons and skins for it. Lots of customization. But damn! Is it good? No! What puts a big minus and outweighs the scales of the review to a negative review is the constant movement of the game from realism to an arcade like Fortnite, which I am not thrilled with, to put it mildly.     Was this game realistic when it came out? Well, it is not for me to answer that question, to be honest. I did not play it when it came out. But if you listen to me, it definitely wasn't realistic from the start, but at the same time it definitely wasn't arcade-like, season-pass, with weird, inappropriate, bright outfits from Fortnite or, God forgive me, Valorant.     Nevertheless, overall the game is very good and it's no worse than, for example, CS2."
578080,185590066,1736874104,1,110694,0.5,"PUBG é basicamente ""Jogos Vorazes"" pra quem acha que tem estratégia, mas só sabe morrer de forma idiota. Você pula de um avião sem plano nenhum, cai no lugar mais lotado possível e encontra... uma panela. Parabéns, agora você está pronto pra enfrentar caras de Fuzil.    O jogo é um desfile de burrices: gente correndo no campo aberto, tentando atirar de longe com uma shotgun ou capotando de moto porque ""pareceu uma boa ideia"". E a zona azul? É só o jeito do jogo dizer: ""morre logo"".    Quando chega no top 10, a galera vira arbusto. Todo mundo deitado no mato, esperando pra ver quem é o primeiro a se mexer e virar churrasco. E no fim, o vencedor sempre é o cara que passou 20 minutos escondido no banheiro.    PUBG é caos, é humilhação, é um monte de gente tentando ser Rambo e falhando miseravelmente.

I got a vehicle, turned around, ran over one and shot the other two.      I got temporarily banned for team killing and being disruptive.  Emailed the developer stating I accepted the ban to described what lead up to my actions.  No regrets and haven't heard back.  I can only feel the developer encourages poor behavior, verbal abuse and only punishes those who stand up to bullying."

578080,185173580,1736419424,1,9941,0.5,"Good game, OG Battle Royale. Slower gameplay but some can like it more than the faster Fortnite or Warzone. Lots of maps, some better than others, for me it lacks choosing map you want to play. When you get the same map 3x times at the row and it is not really one you prefer it can get annoying.  However there are some negatives, they push lots of things for Asian Market, optimalization is really bad for how old the game is. It seems there is zero skill matchmaking, sometimes you destroy others, sometimes, you don't even know how they killed you. Even when it has lots of players, there are still bots in the game, atleast in normal mode, don't know why.   Still, for few sessions in a while, it is always fun."

578080,184816983,1736065729,0,82332,0.929330408573150635,"The OG battle royale game.    TL;DR: Devs missed the mark for Oceania servers and made it unplayable.    The long version:    I will preface this. I am a full-time worker and a casual gamer. I don't play ranked and I don't get enough hours in a day to practice enough to play in competitive matches. Standard matches for me, always.    I have always liked this game. I bought this game for $20 at the end of the horde-mode games era and it was a nice change with a new, unique gameplay style. I could play solo or with mates and it was always a lot of fun with a lot of laughs. Early Access had a lot of bugs but it was a good experience. I played it for quite some time from when it was in beta right through to 1.0 release and a bit beyond. Every update added something to the game and it was always improving.    Fortnite came along, offering a free-to-play battle royale and people left PUBG in droves. I tried Fortnite and didn't like it. It didn't have the same feeling. PUBG has just always had satisfying gun fights. The footsteps, the distant gunfire, the close-up gunfire. Listening to a shot ring out and identifying what sort of weapon it was and how far away they were, and more importantly, how much of a threat they were to you and your squad. PUBG always looked and sounded GOOD. Even when Apex Legends came along, it never had the same raw combat feeling that PUBG offered.    Times changes, jobs changed, people changed and I stopped playing it for a while.    2022. New job, new friends. We're looking for a game to play. They've never really played battle royale games before and Apex was free-to-play, so we played it for a bit. I still didn't like it and they weren't keen on it either. I then learned that PUBG was also now free-to-play. I was very excited and it was very easy to convince my new friends to get it straight away.    We all loved it. They loved it for the same reasons I enjoyed it all those years ago and I loved it because it had new maps and weapons, and a new levelling system. We played it heaps. Season challenges were fun, cosmetics were good and it was a good time. The normal-mode matchmaking seemed decent enough. For me, who hadn't played it for nearly 4 years and for the newcomers, it was a nice mix of easy bots, other new players and a few veterans that we occasionally got the drop on.    2024, October. We've been playing PUBG on and off for two years. We're ok at it. Not great, not terrible. We get enough victories to keep us wanting to come back to it. And it's always fun.    The game developers release an update (Patch 32.1 https://pubg.com/en/news/7810) which included a server region merge. We're in Australia so we've always been on the Oceania (OC) servers. The new update has merged the OC servers with the Southeast Asia (SEA) servers and it is now all hosted out of a SEA server location. The developer's reasoning for this is:  ""As PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS continues to mature and grow, we’ve been looking at the opportunities before us to improve upon the matchmaking experience. As a result, we have decided to merge some of our regions together."" -Dev Letter: Region Merge (https://pubg.com/en/news/7676).    We try it out and very quickly realise the PUBG we know and love is not this. We have determined two distinct reasons:  1. The ping. Australia's Internet is hit-and-miss depending on where you're lucky enough to live. On OC servers we would consistently get between 20ms - 50ms ping while playing. Not amazing, but perfectly playable. The first game we played on the newly merged SEA had an average ping of 150ms. The second game we played was around 180ms. It was unplayable. Doors wouldn't open, loot wouldn't appear on the map and the gunfights were atrocious.  2. The matchmaking. The developers claim this change was to improve the matchmaking experience. It has done anything but that. As I stated at the start, I am a casual player. On OC servers, I was mostly matched with other players around my level (Tier 2, level 260ish) and the rest of the match was filled with bots (for better or worse). On the SEA servers, every single player is level capped at Tier 5, level 500 and they are infinitely better at the game than I am. This normally wouldn't worry me as I've come up against the odd max-level player on OC before. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. You just change your strategy and deal with it. But couple a match full of max-level players with a terrible ping, and the game becomes utterly unplayable and even less enjoyable.    Since the October region merge update, the developers have released 2 more patches with the most recent one (Patch 33.1 https://pubg.com/en-asia/news/7988) actually rolling back a region merge for America. The rollback was due to poor performance across North and South America. As part of the rollback, the developers stated that while they are rolling back the American server merge, they ""will not be rolling back the OC region, and it will remain in its merged state."" -Notice Regarding the High Ping Issues After the Region Merge (https://pubg.com/en/news/7865).    The article goes in to detail the reasons behind rolling back the American merge but not the OC one. While I understand their reasoning for it, it doesn't make it any easier for me to accept it. I've played over 1300 hours of this game and have, for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed it. But these recent server changes have rendered the game unplayable and they clearly have no inclination to fix it for the OC region. I only get a few hours every few days to play games and I am not going to waste those precious moments on a game that no longer works properly.    This review is bittersweet as it has reminded me of all the good times I've had in this game, but I feel like I need to state how I currently feel.    Thank you to anyone who makes the time to read this story."

578080,184381422,1735692484,0,723,0.5,"Came at a perfect timing but for whatever reason didn't hit the ground running in the world of battle royale..   The game’s realistic gunplay and strategic elements, like positioning and map awareness, make every encounter feel high-stakes. PUBG’s massive, open maps—each with distinct terrains and challenges—give players the freedom to approach each match in their own way, whether it’s stealthy survival or aggressive firefights.  However, as someone who played, the game isn’t without its flaws. Performance issues, especially in its earlier days, were a huge frustration, with frame drops, server lag, and clunky movement being common complaints. The steep learning curve and unforgiving nature of the game can make it intimidating for newcomers, and the slower pacing won’t appeal to everyone. Cheaters have also been a persistent problem in the community, undermining the competitive integrity of matches. Additionally, while the core gameplay loop is addictive, the lack of innovation in recent updates and the shift toward monetization through skins and loot boxes have left parts of the player base feeling neglected.  Despite these criticisms, PUBG remains an intense and rewarding experience for those who enjoy tactical, realistic battle royales. While it has been overshadowed in some ways by flashier competitors like Fortnite or Apex Legends, its legacy as the game that put the battle royale genre on the map is undeniable. For players who love high-risk, high-reward gameplay, Even if it feels a little rough around the edges, there are some fun times that can be had within the game."

These are truly some of the worst developers in the world, and that's not even an understatement. They've had over seven years to develop this game, but instead they pump out new cosmetics and microtransactions in every update. I'm almost convinced that they're selling their own ""undetectable for 30 days guarantee"" cheats that you can purchase online for $10 a month. Honestly, with the game being free and the developers not placing any more thought into the game aside from how they can pinch more money out of their player base, I just can't recommend it. Go play one of the countless other battle royales, heck, even Fortnite has better anti-cheat and you'll probably have more fun there than you will here. If this is your thing, or if you're looking to drop $10 for a fun month of chicken dinners, go ahead, but to anyone that likes a fun, fair game, find something else."

578080,183709197,1735178522,1,21259,0.5,"Player Unknown's Battlegrounds, one of the few battle royales I think gets it right. When it comes to how you play, the mechanics, the balance, it feels better. When comparing it to games like Warzone, Fortnite, Apex, and others they all fall short in terms of a learning curve, and raw skill. PUBG Feels organic, competitive, and sharp, where other games feel arcade like.     Some things need improvement since it's come out, and 90 percent have been fixed (sad to say this feels a little too late. ) One thing is you need more players, something all games struggle to gather. I would also like if casual mode would support cross-play. I know it's unfortunate for some of the folks on PS and Xbox, but they also would like to play with friends on PC.     All in all though 7/10 would recommend, even after playing it for over 7 years."

Make lasers visible for enemies.     Option to Auto-Enable volume reducer in pregame lobby/airplanes.    Rebuff m416 recoil (horizontal)    Buff rifles to all have 1 hit headshot againt non armored opponents at close ranges    Reduce per/shot damage on 9mm SMGs to be lower than rifles, Reduce Limb Damage to normal on SMGs  why should the SMG class of weapons have better Handling AND Damage than AR class weapons, it should be a trade off...    Buff Shotgun Base Damage    Changes to Self Res, perhaps the satchel hangs off the hip giving a visual indicator to opponents, remove from floor...?    Remove Sensitivity reduction while taking Med/Boost.    Allow for multiple types of PINGS from one person, ie normal, item, and car.   Will need to add a ""clear marker"" bind/button on map.  Change Yellow (#1 teamate) to Purple, add colored map markers for teamates vehicles, mtb marker?     Allow M16 and MUTANT to take DMR attachments, 1 hit headshot at all ranges against enemies without helmets.    Directional Damage Indicator?     Comprehensive Weapon/Vehicle Statistics,   exact values of Damage/FR/MV/Range, exact values of multipliers and healthpools on each car.    Add storage space to each vehicle, different sizes.    Make Ammo in Backpack Consolidate itself.    New Reticles for 3x, brightness scroll on 4x, full RBG selection on reticles/blood effects independent of ColorBlind mode    Sandbox mode for all pubg+ owners ? or too demanding on servers?    button to turn jammer bag on and off.

Es war wie Counter Strike, nur auf einer riesigen Map und mit Waffen einfach so zum aufheben. Leider ist das Game dann gratis geworden, was viele Cheater angelockt hat. Es war unspielbar, weil die in jedem Game ihr unwesen trieben.    Mittlerweile scheint das Problem deutchlich verbessert worden sein. Seitdem ich wieder angefangen habe es zu spielen, hatten wir in ca 30 Matches vielleicht 1-2 Cheater, einen sehr offensichtlichen. Einige neue Features sind auch dabei: Man kann nun Teammates wiederbeleben, viel mehr Maps als am Anfang, Eisbären die einen sofort zerfleischen, tragbare Fortbewegungsmittel etc...    Es macht einfach mega bock, weil man in dem Spiel auch taktisch agieren muss um es bis ans Ende zu schaffen. Wer bisschen Ahnung hat von Strategie oder Sun Tsu, der kann allein deswegen schon weit kommen. Lass den Feind nicht wissen wo du bist, wie stark du bist oder wann du dich bewegst, dann wird das Spiel einfach *GEEEEEIL*."

This game was fine for awhile both in performance and gameplay after the initial beta. I'm not sure how it's possible to make a game perform so much [i]worse[/i] over time with increasingly better computer parts and software available. Is this like a GTA V issue where they are loading all the terrible microtransactions at once in a giant list and nobody ever cared to fix or even look at the issue? Is it Cities Skyline 2 where they are rendering the teeth as perfectly immaculate 5000 sided polygons even though they aren't visible?    I wanted to write a funny negative review but I'm tired of companies taking something good and ruining it to squeeze out more money. It's like you can feel the pretentious impatience of the owners of Krapton tapping their foot on the ground with their hand out towards you, waiting for money they believe is owed to them, annoyed they have to put in a below minimum effort to extract wealth with an actual product instead of just snatching it from our hands.    Try not to have friends that play one game and that game is PUBG and you really want to play ANYTHING with them but it's only PUBG. That's the real issue, having friends!    TL;DR     PUBG sucks thanks to capitalism and Luigi isn't a playable character"

Pretty much every gun is viable with some being more meta but it doesn't make the other ones obsolete - lots of personal preference as to what loadout/attachments you want to use. Everyone I play with runs different guns/attachments or a different balance of grenades/meds etc. + Few cheaters in EU FPP Squads/Duos (about the same as any competitive game) + You are never going to run out of things to improve at. Recoil, aim, looting, positioning, movement etc. all have nearly uncapped skill ceilings - Poorly optimised, heavily CPU-bound. Running i9 9900k and 2080 @3440x1440 gets around 100-150FPS depending on map and situation but that is mainly due to me running native res  One of my favourite games and it is still being updated, it has a pretty steady player base with matchmaking times being <30s throughout the day."

However, due to the limitations of my previous PC, I could not play until 2024, when I upgraded to a new system. While my current setup allows for 60-70 fps on average on very low settings with a FOV of 95 & native resolution, the performance is not optimal for competitive gameplay.  PUBG is widely regarded as one of the most realistic battle royale games. It distinguishes itself with its emphasis on tactical gameplay and strategy, providing a more immersive experience compared to other titles in the genre. With a diverse array of weapons, attachments, and maps, each match offers a unique experience. The game encourages players to think strategically, manage resources effectively, and plan their actions carefully.  Achieving proficiency in PUBG demands significant effort and expertise. Players must familiarize themselves with the mechanics of various weapons, gain a deep understanding of the maps, and master the use of utilities such as grenades. This process requires dedication and practice, but as players improve, the game becomes increasingly rewarding. The complexity and depth of PUBG make it an excellent choice for those willing to invest time and effort into mastering it."

578080,182787059,1734239449,1,24756,0.476190477609634399,"The hayday of this game has come and gone, it'd be so great if they made efforts to speed up the pace and make it way less looty and add some more to the movement capabilities to sort of align itself with the other BR's that have come and gone as far as pacing is concerned, but despite the slow pace of the game it's still great. Gunfights are rewarding, shenanigans are still plentiful if your friends play with you, and cheaters are way less likely to be encountered than they used to be.    It's interesting to see how this game has gone from being the most popular game on steam, to the least popular BR, and back to the most popular BR again due to the competition all dropping the ball somewhere along the way.    It's still good in 2024, and worth picking up again from time to time."

My first games? 10 matches, 3 kills, and enough frustration to question my life choices. But hey, there’s hope! For example Team Deathmatch - yeah, you’ll get obliterated there too at first, but at least you respawn right away instead of waiting 10 minutes just to die in another 10 second fight.  Solo mode is great for learning the ropes. like how to survive, loot faster, understand the map, and not get swallowed by the circle.  But let’s be real, if your combat skills aren’t there yet, it’s gonna feel like a grind. TDM, though? That’s where you sharpen those gun skills, learn recoil control, and get better at listening for footsteps.  Training mode is your best friend for learning guns, attachments, parachuting, and more. Use it! It helps a lot!  If you love the challenge, stick with it. PUBG rewards dedication, and there’s no better feeling than outplaying someone who’s been here for years.  Also, find some friends and squad up. Trust me, screaming at each other in a squad is 100x more fun than raging solo."

I have spent 1,236 hours in game on Steam alone (around the same on Xbox) and I cannot for the life of me explain why, even after all these years of playing, I keep dipping back into the well. I started on the Xbox One X, and partially why I keep going is because of the fact that I want to earn the same things as I own on my Xbox account, cause I really like them. Some things like the Pumpkin Mask are apparently lost to time on the PC side of things, but others I keep pulling those free pulls due to in game currency that I earn after days or weeks to earn.     Maybe it's the loot box attitude of the progressive skins I still haven't earned, maybe its the chasing of the ever elusive Chicken Dinners which I've won 34, and almost every one of them was a stupid hard battle to get.    But if  PUBG bites you, it sinks it's teeth into your arm, doesn't let go until it *does*. For me I played during the pandemic, and have kept up with it during and long after. I personally just love the quiet of running for long distances across open terrain only to have the silence shattered by distant popcorn of gun fire shattering the silence, and maybe even the flopping of your character as that perfectly timed sniper shot wrecks you.    I love SOLO mode, because to me its the ultimate test of your ability. One person against 99 others, all gunning for you. It's stupid hard, the learning curve is insane, but at the end of the day its the only BR that I like to play. There's something about it, that keeps me coming back.    Come, join in the questionable hit boxes, is that a bot or not?, or the potential hackers on the down low.    But if you find yourself on Erengal, running for your life, taking potshots and dropping smoke to obscure your enemies sight line remember I warned you. Once it bites, it *bites*."

578080,181499977,1733143692,1,29651,0.5,"**PUBG PC: A Slower Battle Royale Experience That Lost Some of Its Magic**      PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) was a groundbreaking title when it first released, setting the stage for the battle royale genre. The game was a masterpiece in its early days, offering a unique and intense experience that captured the attention of millions of players. Its large maps, strategic gameplay, and realistic approach to combat made it feel fresh and exciting. However, as time has passed, the game's slower pace and slower-than-expected updates have led to a shift in the player base.    ### Gameplay and Mechanics    PUBG offers a more methodical and tactical approach to the battle royale genre. Players drop into a massive map and must scavenge for weapons, gear, and supplies while trying to stay alive and avoid being killed by the ever-shrinking play zone. Unlike other battle royales, PUBG's gameplay is slower, with an emphasis on positioning, cover, and long-range combat. The gunplay is solid, and the variety of weapons adds depth, but the overall pacing of the game can sometimes feel a bit sluggish compared to other fast-paced shooters.    ### Slow Pace and Changing Player Base    The slower pace of PUBG is one of the reasons why it’s started to lose its player base over time. Many new, fast-paced FPS games like Apex Legends and Warzone have taken over the battle royale scene, offering quicker matches, more action-packed gameplay, and frequent updates. These games cater to players looking for a more fast-paced experience, and as a result, PUBG's once-thriving community has seen a decline. While PUBG still offers a more methodical, strategic experience, it's increasingly seen as a slower and more deliberate alternative compared to the competition.    ### Performance and Updates    The performance in PUBG has always been a point of contention. While the game can run well on higher-end systems, players on lower-end rigs can experience frame drops, stuttering, and general performance issues. Additionally, PUBG has struggled with consistent updates. While new content is released occasionally, it feels like the game doesn’t receive the same level of attention as other games in the genre, which has contributed to the game's decline in popularity.    ### Verdict    PUBG was once a masterpiece, pioneering the battle royale genre and offering an immersive experience that captivated players worldwide. However, as the genre has evolved and new, faster-paced games have emerged, PUBG’s slower gameplay and occasional performance issues have caused it to lose some of its charm. It’s still a solid game for those who prefer a more methodical, strategic battle royale experience, but it no longer holds the same dominant position it once did.    ⭐ **Rating**: 7/10    PUBG is a solid game that still holds appeal for players who enjoy a slower, more tactical approach to battle royale. However, its pace and lack of updates make it less appealing in a landscape filled with faster, more action-oriented FPS games. It’s a game that’s hard to recommend to newcomers but still a decent option for those who enjoy the slower pace and strategic gameplay.    Please give me an award if you like my review! 😊"

It’s free to play now, which is great, because the time you’ll spend slogging through its chaos is worth far more than money. And honestly, you’ll probably wish you could get that time back.

578080,180609447,1732831759,1,26351,0.52173912525177002,"The September 11 attacks,[f] commonly known as 9/11,[g] were four coordinated Islamist terrorist suicide attacks carried out by al-Qaeda against the United States in 2001. Nineteen terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners, crashing the first two into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and the third into the Pentagon (headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia. The fourth plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania during a passenger revolt. The September 11 attacks killed 2,977 people, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in history. In response to the attacks, the United States waged the multi-decade global war on terror to eliminate hostile groups deemed terrorist organizations, as well as the foreign governments purported to support them.  Ringleader Mohamed Atta flew American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan at 8:46 a.m.[h] Seventeen minutes later,[i] United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower. Both collapsed within an hour and forty-one minutes,[j] bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the complex and damaging or destroying nearby buildings. American Airlines Flight 77 flew towards Washington, D.C. and crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., causing a partial collapse. The fourth and final flight, United Airlines Flight 93, also changed course towards Washington, believed by investigators to target either the United States Capitol or the White House. Alerted to the previous attacks, the passengers revolted against the hijackers who crashed the aircraft into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 10:03 a.m. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered an indefinite ground stop for all air traffic in U.S. airspace, preventing any further aircraft departures until September 13 and requiring all airborne aircraft to return to their point of origin or divert to Canada. The actions undertaken in Canada to support incoming aircraft and their occupants were collectively titled Operation Yellow Ribbon.  That evening, the Central Intelligence Agency informed President George W. Bush that its Counterterrorism Center had identified the attacks as having been the work of Al-Qaeda under Osama bin Laden. The United States formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which rejected U.S. terms to expel Al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite its leaders. The U.S.'s invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty—its only usage to date—called upon allies to fight al-Qaeda. As U.S. and NATO invasion forces swept through Afghanistan, bin Laden eluded them. He denied any involvement until 2004, when excerpts of a taped statement in which he accepted responsibility for the attacks were released. Al-Qaeda's cited motivations included U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia and sanctions against Iraq. The nearly decade-long manhunt for bin Laden concluded on May 2, 2011, when he was killed during a U.S. military raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The War in Afghanistan continued for another eight years until the agreement was made in February 2020 for American and NATO troops to withdraw from the country.  Excluding the hijackers, the attacks killed 2,977 people, injured thousands more and gave rise to substantial long-term health consequences while also causing at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. It remains the deadliest terrorist attack in history as well as the deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement personnel in American history, killing 343 and 72 members, respectively. The loss of life stemming from the impact of Flight 11 made it the most lethal multi-plane crash in aviation history followed by the death toll incurred by Flight 175. The destruction of the World Trade Center and its environs seriously harmed the U.S. economy and induced global market shocks. Many other countries strengthened anti-terrorism legislation and expanded their powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The total number of deaths caused by the attacks, combined with the death tolls from the conflicts they directly incited, has been estimated by the Costs of War Project to be over 4.5 million.[18] Cleanup of the World Trade Center site (colloquially ""Ground Zero"") took eight months and was completed in May 2002, while the Pentagon was repaired within a year. After delays in the design of a replacement complex, six new buildings were planned to replace the lost towers, along with a museum and memorial dedicated to those who were killed or injured in the attacks. The tallest building, One World Trade Center, began construction in November 2006; it opened in November 2014. Memorials to the attacks include the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial at the Pennsylvania crash site."

Literally unplayable as I cant even sit in the main menu for 5 minutes without the game crashing and blue screen of death.  I get prompted to install .NET 3.5 (which is already installed), the install then fails, and now I get a blue screen of death within 3-5 minutes of firing up PUBG. LITERALLY JUST PUBG. I can play anything else under the sun, no problems...but PUBG? Not happening. Uninstalled to save my hardware from continuous crashing.  Do you guys just huff compressed air before reviewing code dependencies and error handling when pushing patches or was alienating your player base with piss poor development and patching part of the plan from the start??    Edit: Redacting my negative review. PUBG did push an update that required .NET to be a certain version. The crashing and BSOD issues were symptoms of an large OS issue unrelated to the game. Windows had a corrupted file that was preventing OS updates and ultimately causing system errors with the .NET framework that escalated to a point where I couldn't even log into the desktop. Fixed the core issue with a Windows system repair, pushed the updates, and everything runs smoothly now. Apologies for being unhinged in my rage. Positive review. Love the game."

While many players acknowledge its peak during its heyday, I continue to return to PUBG because of its unique gameplay and lasting appeal. It remains a truly exceptional experience for me, even as the gaming landscape evolves. I REALLY love this game"
578080,178624347,1731080551,0,16131,0.517985641956329346,"I’ve been a big fan of PUBG PC, but my recent experience has been nothing short of frustrating. Despite having a solid gaming setup—16GB RAM, an i5 processor, and an NVIDIA 3050 GPU on a Lenovo gaming laptop—I’m facing major performance issues. The game feels choppy and laggy, even after clearing my RAM and shutting down all other applications before launching it.  The biggest downside? Players can’t even choose their own server! PUBG claims to select the nearest server for optimal ping, but it’s doing the complete opposite. I constantly deal with unbearable latency that ruins the gameplay experience, even though my setup should easily handle the game. If PUBG allowed players to manually choose their server, it would help tremendously. Gamers want control over their settings, and choosing a stable server is a huge part of that. Until this feature is added, I hesitate to recommend PUBG PC to others. If smooth gameplay and responsive controls are a priority for you, this issue might be a dealbreaker.  But that’s not even the worst part. It feels like PUBG is making fun of genuine players. Some player movements are ridiculously fast, and their aim is so unrealistically precise that it completely breaks the core mechanics of the game. It’s obvious that many of them are using hacks. Yet, what are the developers doing about it? Absolutely nothing meaningful. They entertain this nonsense, allowing hackers to ruin the game and destroy the mood for genuine players. Temporary bans? What are we supposed to make of that? It’s a joke. Hackers get banned temporarily, then come back with new accounts, continuing to ruin the experience for everyone.  After playing for 136 hours, I see no real change—just temporary fixes that don’t address the root problem. PUBG has become a playground for hackers, and the developers seem more focused on ignoring the issue than fixing it. It’s disappointing to see a game with such potential being dragged down by poor server management and a lack of effective anti-cheat measures.  Until PUBG takes these issues seriously, I can’t recommend it to anyone looking for a fair and enjoyable gaming experience."

You can easily spot them. They kill you always instantly, usually they have headshot ratio around 40-50%. You can also see them getting 30+ kills in the match and leaving 10 seconds before the match finishes, I bet so that people don't report them because they forgot the name already when the match finishes and report button appears.

The devs keep adding anime skins and ‘limited-edition’ outfits, because nothing says ‘gritty survival’ like a neon ninja riding a motorbike through an airstrike.  At this point, it’s less of a battle royale and more of a cosplay convention with very aggressive laser pointers. The real game isn't survival — it's spotting the guy using wallhacks before he headshots you from 500 meters away."

578080,178419370,1730771300,1,4744,0.5,"PUBG (PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds) is the ultimate test of nerves, skill, and strategy, where 100 players drop onto an island and only one (or one team) makes it out on top. Imagine an intense game of hide-and-seek—but with sniper rifles, frying pans, and adrenaline pumping action. If you’ve ever dreamed of parachuting into a war zone, scrambling for weapons, and battling to be the last player standing, then PUBG is your perfect playground.  The premise is as straightforward as it gets: you drop onto a massive map with nothing but your wits and whatever you can scavenge. From the moment you land, it’s a mad scramble for guns, armor, and gear, knowing that every other player is doing the exact same thing. The map shrinks over time, forcing everyone into closer proximity until there’s nowhere left to hide. Every match is a new adventure, where your only goal is survival—by any means necessary.  PUBG is all about strategy and adaptability. You can play as a stealthy lone wolf, staying under the radar until the final circle, or go in guns blazing to eliminate threats early. Either way, you’ll need a plan, especially when you’re creeping through abandoned houses or crossing open fields under enemy fire. Sometimes, the best weapon is a frying pan (not just for combat, but for defense too—nothing says “bulletproof” like a pan on your back). The loot system keeps you on your toes, as you can go from a crowbar-wielding scavenger to a fully geared-up warrior if you play your cards right.  Playing with friends adds a whole new layer of fun. In squad mode, teamwork is key, and you’ll find yourself sharing loot, calling out enemy positions, and coming up with on-the-fly strategies to secure the win. Plus, there’s nothing like the shared panic of running for cover when the “blue zone” closes in or the hilarity of flipping your vehicle just as you spot an enemy team. Communication and coordination turn PUBG into a wild, tactical experience where every match feels fresh and unpredictable.  Visually, PUBG nails the gritty realism of a true battle royale, with detailed environments, weather effects, and sprawling maps that make each encounter feel intense and immersive. The various maps—Erangel’s rural towns, Miramar’s desert, Sanhok’s jungles, and Vikendi’s snowfields—each bring their own challenges and advantages, so no two games ever feel quite the same. And don’t even get me started on the sound design—footsteps, gunshots, and distant explosions create a nerve-wracking soundscape that’ll have you checking your surroundings every few seconds.  PUBG is fast-paced, nerve-wracking, and incredibly rewarding. Each victory feels like a hard-earned achievement, and even the near-wins are unforgettable. Whether you’re a battle-hardened veteran or a new recruit, there’s a thrill in parachuting into the unknown, scavenging for weapons, and working your way to the top. So grab your squad, queue up, and get ready to jump into the action—  who knows, maybe you’ll walk away with that “Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner!”"

Apex lobbies are cracked unbalanced and no fun whatsoever and Fortshite is a cheap filler compared to this as far as the TPP aspect. COD/Battlefield are for scrubs so the FPS aspect cooks those too. Would recommend. People are still 30/70 shit rats but the good ones are okay."

578080,178115538,1730401069,1,26556,0.5,"Preface: I only play the solo mode in this game, I don't play squads or ranked.    PUBG is a well-made game in my opinion. The crux of the game, for me, comes down to stakes. I enjoy the looting aspect; it's simple enough to where I look forward to finding certain attachments (which are balanced but specialized, leading some to be best in slot just by nature of the game) or weapons (it's important to have favorite guns/attachments otherwise you'll feel lost). Early game fights can be exciting but you quickly stop caring about kills if you constantly drop where there's lots of people.    I think PUBG hits a very specific mark on the spectrum of frustrating reality to fun immersive gameplay. The movement is momentum based without feeling too sluggish, the gunplay is difficult but really any player can be effective at any range by choosing a playstyle that suits their technical skill with the game.    As far as ease of entry goes, its mostly enjoyable for people who are already skilled players, but if you're good at shooters you can learn this game quickly if you want to.    There is certainly a meta to abuse; SMGs (PP-Bizon, MP5K, MP9 are good) are far easier to control and DMRs (SLR, Mini14, MK12, Dragunov) are objectively very good and versatile. ARs and snipers have an arguably higher skill ceiling, but even within that you have guns that have good damage profiles and are still very manageable when spraying (M416, ACE32, and K2 come to mind). The snipers are basically exactly what you'd want out of a realistic shooter that isn't frustrating.    I am heavily biased as this was one of the first shooters I dug my teeth into, but I've been getting back into the game over the past few months and have been heavily enjoying it. I've found that the Asia/Europe servers have higher skill players and more consistent playerbase, and it's actually very competitive and enjoyable. If you're new and from US/Canada, I'd say try NA servers as theres more lower skill players (I think) and bots (which are annoying but do shoot back and can kill you if you are really bad or really get caught out lol).    If you haven't played and it looks fun to you, it is. It's frustrating, rewarding, and immersive. There will be games where you get a bit of FOMO, but if you get careless you'll be humbled.    Short Beginners Guide:    The most important thing, in my opinion, is positioning. If you're able to keep everyone on the map in front of you and in predictable spots, you'll have a much better time and you'll be able to stay focused on scouting without feeling overwhelmed or paranoid.    It's easy to watch people play the game and feel like shit abt ur skill level, but remember that they really don't represent a lot of the playerbase. There are plenty of people who miss shots, shoot DMRs slowly or spray randomly. If you're new you'll feel somewhat at home, but there is still a sizeable skill gap. Just keep that in mind.    Start off by picking one or two gun pairings that work for what you want. Personally, I'd recommend sniping so you can just practice landing the one shot kill and still have a chance to get lucky against more skilled opponents. Things get a bit trickier towards the end game, as more and more people have level 3 helmets. But if you take your time and land some good shots, you can still be more than effective even without an AWM or AMR (the only two weapons that can kill through a LVL3 Helmet other than a crossbow lol)    Balance your time between BR and one of the TDM esque modes. It's good to have as many gunfights as you can to practice your technical skills, but remember that people play much more aggressive than they normally would, so it's not a perfect 1-to-1 with BR mode. If you really want to be a good player and get wins and have satisfying games, it's important to build technical and strategic foundations (and just get comfortable with the maps)    PUBG is one of the better and more fun shooters out there in my opinion, it doesnt allow you to move like you can in Apex or have the same level of reality as Tarkov (similar but different genre I know) but it has room for variance in gunfights, making enough games pretty interesting in my opinion."

578080,177878473,1730064172,1,19833,0.5,"PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS : By Triple F    ""PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"" developed by PUBG Corporation, is a pioneering entry in the battle royale genre that introduced millions to the adrenaline-fueled concept of ""last person standing"" gameplay. Released initially as an early access title in 2017, ""PUBG"" quickly amassed a huge player base due to its intense, survival-focused gameplay and realistic gun mechanics. Set on sprawling maps like Erangel, Miramar, and Sanhok, players drop into a vast battleground, scavenging for weapons, gear, and supplies while facing off against up to 99 other competitors. The objective is simple yet brutal: outlast everyone else and claim the top spot.    The game’s open-world maps are one of its defining features. Each location is distinct, from the lush forests of Erangel to the desert dunes of Miramar, each providing unique gameplay dynamics and requiring different strategies. For example, Miramar’s open desert areas favor long-range sniping, while Sanhok’s dense foliage creates close-quarters combat encounters. The maps are huge, requiring players to constantly move and adjust, especially as the shrinking safe zone forces them closer to each other. This map design keeps each match fresh, as players must quickly adapt to the terrain and find cover, which adds to the game’s immersive feel.    Looting is a central mechanic in ""PUBG"" that balances tension with reward. Players start with nothing and must scavenge buildings, campsites, and military complexes for weapons, armor, and medical supplies. The loot system is unpredictable, meaning a player might land in a high-risk area and find powerful gear or come up empty-handed, making it a calculated gamble each time. This element of randomness forces players to adapt on the fly and promotes a mix of aggressive and stealthy play-styles. Deciding whether to pursue better gear or avoid high-traffic areas where ambushes are likely is a constant, high-stakes decision that drives the core of ""PUBG""’s gameplay.    ""PUBG""’s gunplay is another standout element, widely considered one of the most realistic in the genre. With a wide variety of guns, attachments, and ammunition types, each weapon feels unique and requires skill to handle effectively. Bullet drop, recoil, and range factors are all crucial, meaning that mastering ""PUBG""’s shooting mechanics takes time. The game’s approach to realism means that even minor attachments like compensators, scopes, and grips make a noticeable difference in how guns perform. As a result, ""PUBG"" demands precision and tactical decision-making, especially in firefights where positioning and weapon choice can mean the difference between survival and elimination.    The tension in ""PUBG"" reaches its peak in the final minutes of a match, as the play area shrinks to a tiny circle. This forces players into close-quarters encounters, creating nerve-wracking moments where survival instincts and quick reflexes are put to the test. At this stage, environmental awareness becomes essential, as players use every resource, including sound cues like footsteps or gunshots, to track opponents. The gradual reduction in safe zones is one of the game's strongest mechanics, creating a palpable tension that intensifies with every passing second and ultimately driving the dynamic pace of the game.    However, ""PUBG"" has some drawbacks, particularly related to performance and optimization. While it has improved significantly since its early access days, the game still suffers from occasional frame drops, especially on lower-end hardware, which can affect gameplay fluidity. Additionally, ""PUBG"" has struggled with issues related to hackers and cheating, though the developers have implemented anti-cheat measures to address this problem. While these issues are less prevalent than in the past, they remain an occasional concern for players, detracting somewhat from the game’s competitive integrity.    In summary, ""PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS"" remains a genre-defining title with a gripping combination of survival mechanics, realistic gunplay, and strategic depth. It may not be as flashy as some newer battle royale games, but its intense, immersive experience and emphasis on tactical gameplay continue to attract a loyal player base. Despite some technical shortcomings, ""PUBG"" stands out for its raw, gritty approach to the battle royale genre and is a must-play for fans of realistic, high-stakes shooters. For those who thrive on competition, strategy, and high tension, ""PUBG"" offers an experience that few other games can match."

I have my own reasons which I'm listing Below.    1) In trailer and photos you will see 4 dudes are helping each other in dire situations, Nothing Found Here like that instead You will see in [b]SEA Server[/b] one mate goes East other goes west third is noob and 4th is offline. communication is not possible unless you are Chinese. Newbies killing their Saver pros, not helpful in difficult times even if they understand you. Match-making is not based on language it is based on server.    [b]In EU Server,[/b]    Unless you have better Internet playing there is not an easy task, even Native Europeans are facing High ping problem. You will get better help from fellow players and Teammates If you are good enough in English. Ping Issue Destroys such pleasure.    2) Good stuff finder Cheat : I doubt some players are using good item finder cheat while I get mostly M16A4 and Crowbar whereas my opponent gets an M416 or S12K while in Building That's Why I don't land just with my foe even if he is not cheating who knows some are lucky prince and princess. you have pan in hand and they are coming to kill you with AK or Scar.    3) Koreans know How to Advertise their game : To attract players they will show everything they can, they launch attractive events etc. when you reach there you will find it like a mirage.    4) Not Based on fight completely But about 60 % game holds Fashion theme, You will find yourself like you are in a Fancy dress competition. You can see in my screenshots and artworks needless to say.    5) Worthless items that you can't sell in steam market, if you are in PUBG for over a year your inventory would be full of trash."

The direction PUBG has taken in the last few years has been questionable at best. Scant regard, bordering on complete disregard, of the player base in favour of cosmetic skins and absolutely pointless additions to the game in order to push microtransactions nearly destroyed the whole player base. This latest update has completed the cull. Unless you live in one of the countries that actually have a server in it this game is now impossible to play. Well done to the numpties at Krafton."

They bought a great game from playerunknown, but I think it's safe to say that Tencent/Krafton have finally milked pubg dry. Years of fortnite skins, money-driven changes and low quality content with no regard for maintaining playability or at least keeping the original setting. The performance has gotten so inconsistent, I would genuinely prefer if they just sent me the frames in a powerpoint file so I could skip through them myself. The first two matches of the day display a combined 50 frames MAX or crash right away before the game finally wakes up and gives me a playable match. Nah bro... straight up insufficient.  And don't even get me started on the borderline illegal monetization practices... I can't even think of a mobile game that has a more predatory and scummy shop than pubg.

Worst of which was the Battle Pass. If you payed for the game  back at release, you got what's called a PLUS + access which just means you get benefits that are not that good, such as increased RANKED xp and an outfit that looks like a metal head. Nowadays this game is FREE and has a ton of micro transactions and 10 different currencies to use to get shards 1/10000 in order to craft a really cool looking outfit. The only redeeming quality of this game is the gameplay and maps. They're cool and fun and the weapons they have are fun to use. The money grab this game has become in unruly and truly sad to see in a game that was once a relic of its own. The battle pass doesn't even use the in game currencies its always payed for so you can't earn a new one for next pass if you wanted, which is what games like COD and Fortnite do. I really gotta say it, I used to be a PUBG > Fortnite guy. Now it's a Fortnite > PUBG for sure. Especially since the addition of No Build Mode."

578080,177311106,1729312771,0,405,0.5,"Rating: 2/5 Stars (would be higher if not for the pervasive cheating issue)    Review:    I recently revisited this game after a multi-year hiatus, eager to recapture the excitement that once drew me in. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was short-lived. The game, which was once a thrilling experience, is now overrun with bots and cheaters, leaving genuine players like myself disheartened and questioning the point of continuing.    Key Issues:    Rampant Cheating: Despite the passage of time, the game's cheating problem persists, with no evident robust measures in place to deter or effectively ban offenders.    Repeated Frustration: The consistent pattern of being outmatched by clearly illicit means is demotivating. The joy of competition is lost when facing opponents who flaunt the rules.    Wasted Time and Effort:  Lengthy Matchmaking: Only to be met with an unbalanced, frustrating experience.    Tedious Loading Processes: Both for the game itself and between matches, adding to the overall dissatisfaction.    Brief, Unfulfilling Gameplay Sessions: Scavenging for minimal gear, only to fall victim to a cheater's bullet within minutes, rendering the entire experience feel pointless."

It remains an extremely challenging and fairly realistic battle royale experience, clunks, chunks, warts, lumps and all. It's about as polished as the inside of public urinal at times, but remains mechanically sound nonetheless and true to itself in a world of character-skin-collecting, emote-expressing digital wallet sucking other competitors rely too heavily on. Is it perfect? Don't be silly- of course not. Is it infuriating at times? You betcha. But the community is overall far less toxic than most, the realism is relatable, and it offers quite a challenge even to this day. Overall, PUBG is a solid 7-10."
578080,176903202,1728748737,1,18585,0.5,"I recently started playing ranked matches in PUBG, and I have to say, it’s been a frustrating experience. One of the biggest issues I’ve encountered is the matchmaking system. Despite being in Silver rank, I often find myself facing off against players who are much higher-ranked, including Diamonds. This feels incredibly unfair and makes the matches feel unbalanced.  Additionally, the limitations on teaming up with friends further complicate the experience. It’s disheartening to feel like you can’t enjoy the game with your mates due to the rank requirements. The matchmaking system should ensure that players are paired more appropriately based on their skill levels to provide a fairer and more enjoyable experience.  Overall, while PUBG has a lot of potential, the current ranked system needs significant improvements to make it a more equitable and enjoyable environment for all players."

Eu me pergunto se a intenção é reviver ou matar de vez o jogo.[/h1]  Eu achava que os desenvolvedores eram só burros, e que não sabiam o que os jogadores queriam. Mas depois dessa atualização de servidores, onde obrigaram todo o continente sul-americano jogar em servidores norte americanos, percebi que não é só isso. Antes o alerta de ping quando chegava aos 100, ja ficava amarelo. Hoje vc entra na partida, com 150 de ping e continua branco. Mau-caratismo puro. Fizeram na maldade sabendo que ia prejudicar a experiência de todo mundo daqui. Antes ja sofriamos com a escolha de mapa, que era inexistente. Uma rotação com mapas demais, e que dificilmente caia nos preferidos de cada um. Cansava mais ficar tentando cair um mapa que vc queria jogar do que jogar o game em si. Agora além disso, quando cair no mapa que vc quer jogar, se contente com 150ms de ping que não te deixa nem abaixar sem bugar a câmera. Lamentável. Mas Por quê tudo isso? Corte de custo? Sinceramente acho que a intenção desses caras é ficar com o game só na região da Ásia, aonde dá mais dinheiro. Não é atoa que ja tem anos que todos os cosméticos do game, além de serem caros, são feitos pra agradar uma certa demografia. Tá descarado, só não vê quem não quer.  Se voltarem atrás, ótimo. Mas hoje, PUBG na américa do sul morreu. Pra quem comprou o jogo em 2017 como eu, e pra todos que gastaram uma grana em passes, cosméticos etc... Meus pêsames."

You add in that you can't understand your squad due to the language barrier and it's pointless.  I've really enjoyed this game for many a year, had some great games and met some good people, but this is the end of it for me sadly; unless they reverse this decision. They would have been better off merging us with NA as yes the ping would still be an issue, but you could at least end up with a squad that you can communicate with.

578080,175959823,1727539421,0,170788,0.5,"Been through thick and thin with this game since launch. I’ve supported the company with in-game purchases over the years, and never violated terms of service in 7 years. A couple of days ago, I had a random teammate purposely run me over with a car. My buddy rezzed me, and I team killed the random for his actions. He reported me, and I caught an entire week-long ban. After opening a ticket, Krafton refused to shorten the ban. The worst part of this experience is that they give 24-hour bans to first offense cheaters and only step it up if they continue cheating. How is one instance of team killing 7x worse than someone blatantly cheating in your game? Krafton is a joke. I’ve put up with your maintenance periods at peak times on Tuesday nights, your over priced money-grabbing gambling mechanics to level up gun skins, your unwillingness to listen to your community, and complete lack to properly control cheating within your game, but this is the last straw for me."

At least it's not like COD where they don't give a crap about their player base. On that note. How do you feel about cheaters in games? Like, why? Can't you play a game the way it was made to be played? Cheating has come from the roots of undisciplined children who's parents couldn't bring themselves to give any good directions to their kids. They will forever look to other methods to win than actually playing the right way. Which is why they will never know what true success is like in life. Because, it wasn't given to them, and it never will be."

I think this game is a ton of fun with friends, HANDS DOWN. 2. This game is not for the faint of heart. This game has one of the highest skill learning curves of any game, let me explain. This game is one of the hardest FPS games out there. Almost any Pro Player from other FPS games have stated that PUBG is difficult to learn because of recoil control and correct positioning. 3. This game will require LOTS of hours if wanting to be anywhere decent in the game. Do NOT be discouraged if you die after 5 minutes of landing or spending 20 minutes looting and then coming across your first combat interaction and dying and then being sent back to lobby. THIS GAME AT FIRST WILL FEEL LIKE A LOOT SIMULATOR haha. 4. Once you get used to the mechanics the game becomes increasingly addicting.  5. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you play Team Deathmatch either first or to warm up, Team Deathmatch is amazing for learning recoil control so for new players I highly recommend it, because lets be honest YOU will not get better at this game if your engagements are low. Higher Engagements = Better Aim/Recoil Control.   IF you can get passed the learning curve and you aren't too quick to being pissed when you die then THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. I love this game and will continue to play no matter how mad this game gets me."

578080,175501057,1726968769,1,42985,0.5,"Been playing this game for years now, so here are my 2 cents on the game for new players.  This game is hard, like vary hard, if you are new you will die a lot to older players.  So here are a few things you can do to get better at the game.  1. Don't cheat.  You will not get better if you do cheat and you will make the game worse by doing so. 2. Listen to your surroundings.  This can make you win or loss a game just because you could not hear where the other players shots are coming from so you put your back towards the player shooting at you instead of facing them. 3. Do not land at popular sites, this is an easy and fast way to go back to the lobby, instead look for locations at least 1km from where the plane is flying and go there. 4. Play with friends and use VOIP.  You can use the in game VOIP, but what I use is Discord. 5. Don't go more then 100 m from your team mates.  This way when one of you is in trouble, 3 of your team mates are at positions to aid you.  Also don't be to close to each other, as this makes you easier to spot and makes it harder for you and your team mates to return fire when you are in a fire fight. 6. When you see someone, ping them so your team mates know where they are and can aid it taking them down. 7. Take a automatic weapon and a long range weapon (DMR or SR).  My suggestion for a new player is a SMG and a DMR.  For SMG use one of the 3, UMP, VECTOR, MP5K.  As for DMR's, use SLR or DRAGUNOV. 8. Carry at least 4 First Aid kits, 10 bandages, and 4 boosts. 9. Carry 2-3 Smoke grenades. 10. Just have fun."

They may put out reports of how many cheaters they ban each week, but the truth is they only do this to distract the players from the fact that they can't actually do a thing to curb the amount of cheaters. I can't play this game, it has never been so bad as it's been the last few months, it is so frustrating. I have no illusion of hope that the devs will ever be able to control this issue."

The genre is UNDERSTOOD as battle royale...; -drop in (usually) with little to nothing, & EQUIP yourself, -endure the game to be the 'LAST ONE STANDING', or last team, (hopefully), -the game looks great in any mode, first person or third person, -the maps totally account for all the seasonal effects available, there's your ARID, your SNOWY, your Jungle, your URBAN, & some..  It isn't 'GORY OR DISGUSTING' in appearance & during gameplay, & as mentioned earlier accessible.

578080,174881534,1726251156,1,7753,0.5,"PUBG was one of my first battle royale games, and I still come back to it even after all this time. The thrill of dropping into the map, scrambling for weapons, and fighting to be the last person standing never gets old. The tension in the game is unmatched—you’re always on edge, not knowing if someone’s around the corner or if a sniper has you in their sights.  The gunplay is solid, and the variety of weapons keeps things fresh. But, not gonna lie, the game can feel a bit janky at times. I've had my fair share of lag and some weird glitches, but when the game is running smoothly, it’s an intense experience.  The game can be a bit tough for beginners, especially with so many experienced players out there, but stick with it, and you'll get better. Teaming up with friends also makes it way more fun! Overall, PUBG is still one of the best battle royale games out there, even if it's not perfect."

578080,174696290,1726006928,0,22908,0.664952933788299561,"Played PUBG since the launch day. Today its dead  Minecraft hunger games was the first in its kind. Got h1z1 mod just to play battlegrounds before it was a hit. Then PUBG was released and it was so much fun. Miss the old pubg. The way it was challenging, it took a lot of time getting into fights and getting good at the game. But yet, it was very even with every enemy you came across. It felt like every battle was a 50/50. Just the thrill of getting 1-2 kills was an exciting experience. To become the last man/team that survived was an unforgetting moment. Everyone was at the same level in a way, average players. To find enemies, you really had to pay attention to the sounds and visuals of movements. Its the slow paced action that was really the hit. Such as the running. It was nice in a way when i think about it, because that's the time when you caught up with your mates in discord. It wasn't these quick action fights like Cod, that wasn't meant for pubg. It was these boring moments of running, finding a car and looting that made the gun fights soo worth it.   Until the map release of Sanhok, the game was great (Thats when i stopped playing the game). I believe its because of the large scaled map before, it was more of a challenge with bigger maps. Sanhok ruined it in a way to have faster paced gunfights. If you wanted to get good at the game, then you landed in the hotspot of the map, such as School on Erangel. But that was really it. Sanhook which is twice as small than both Erangel and Miramar. Sanhook made it feel more quick paced game action like COD no matter where you landed. These people will get drastically much better at the game than your avarage player, since they get more combat time.   I tried to play the game recently. Was a terrible experience and the game is not fun anymore. You either play against an Ai or a player who is impossible to play against, cant even see the enemy. They are just that good. Now you also have these ridiculous payment options like fortnite. Which isnt that big of a problem, they make a ton of money of it and we will see this in every other game in the future, it wont be stopped.   Point is, the old PUBG was one of the best games i have ever played and made alot of memories with my friends playing it. Im glad i got to play the game in its peek time. Today, the game is dead and it should stay that way so they can start making a new game instead of adding new things in an old game.  Anyone that agrees?"

I know that most consumers nowadays since the game is free are some single dudes that love dressing their character up in anime cosplay but for God's sake if you're gonna do that at least dont leave your original customers behind, release some cool stuff for us too.

Seems like there's a lot more loot than there used to be (m249s and AUGs just laying around rather than being loot crate only). Also more vehicles, more maps, more everything. They've added a lot of new content since the last time I played.

Way before this game ever got popular it was still a blast. The updates they've done over the years have been for the better, I just wish they could do a little better with the cheater issue. But hey, cheaters will be in every game like this so it is what it is. Definitely recommend if you're tire of the call of duty style BR games."

I don't think you understand how fast that is. It's incomprehensible. You watch TV, Stream a movie, you see this tiny simple machine streaming its pre-fabricated 8.2 Million pixel frames 30 to 60 times per second while you mindlessly absorb the content, but can you comprehend how fast that is? Now take that, and imagine those frames don't even exist yet. This large array of polygons (multi-sided shapes made from those pixels), each having calculations performed on them to construct this seemingly-realistic 2D made 3D shape, tethered to other polygons, perspective applied, producing shapes, manifesting as guns, rocks, grass, dirt, trees, sparks, dust. Textures applied. Each polygon wrapped in a mathematically segmented image, shaded and glared and blurred in cohesion with light sources, to mimic a real environment. And each of those 8.2 Million pixel frames created, on-the-fly to give you this digital fiction that your brain can relate to. And the thousands of dollars you spend to speed up the process even more, so your brain can relate even more, making you go ""wow"". What else does it mean though? If you move your mouse 1cm to the left or right, in 1/10 of a second, 6 to 12 8.1 million pixel images were calculated and rendered. Do you know what else can be rendered? Millions of ways to deceive you. Deceive your mind. Deceive your logic. And that's what it means to participate in a digital fiction. And PUBG is exactly that. A digital fiction. Did you miss or were you dead-on? It doesn't matter what the screen showed you, I'm asking you. Why did you move 8 degrees in that 1/4 centimeter in 0.01375 seconds you moved your mouse this time, but 9 degrees the next? How did that enemy know exactly where to move to make sure you didn't see him taking that position? Did he even take that position, or is it there because he could have taken that position? When he shot you, and in just the right spot, did he actually aim? Or did it happen so fast, you wouldn't know? Why this time? Why not last time, or the time before? Have these developers decided to program probabilistic events, or opportunistic events? Why with the same gun, same attachments, was the sway so erratic this time and not last? Did you overcompensate, or did the digital fiction already calculate your reaction time and behaviors and know you were so focused on the action-at-hand you didn't have the brainpower left to observe the eccentricity, nor perfection of your movements, and took advantage? If you were good... just as good, better even- would you become confident? Would this confidence and potential carry over into life? Would your standards for yourself increase? What benefit would you serve the machine of reality if you knew your true potential? Perhaps the designers have different plans for you. So play PUBG. Play these games built by the same institutions that want to keep you in a submissive, subordinate, and easily manipulated state of mind."

PUBG makes millions on every pass, collab, or event and still dont do anything about hackers. its really sad to see and experience.   essentially you throwing away money and about 30 minutes of your time every match you get into. just to be laughed at by some hacker who doesnt know what skill is. PATHETIC   BATTLE EYE(anti-cheat) is on a KERNAL level access and the hackers literally have see through hacks. they dont care of what so ever. .!.. pubg is gonna die, so dont throw your time away playing this game. i got 3,500 hours. and i regret it."

Breaks between matches + looking for new players + looking for people on the map for 10 minutes to be killed out of nowher. You can spend 20 minutes in the game and have only  1-2 kills.  Weapons have too much recoil as a result a pro player kills you from a kilometer away and you as a rookie can't hit him even from 50 meters away. Deatch metch is the same. Everywhere pro players don't give you a chance to learn the game or have fun. I used to aspire to be a pro but nowadays I want to relax and have a semi-casual time. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE IN THIS GAME. WASTE OF TIME    Also progress is to slow.

578080,173272457,1724540286,0,24254,0.5,"Terrible game. I gave it a second chance after all these years and was sad to see the game hasn't improved at all. Firstly it's performance. A Ryzen 7 + 3060 sometimes barely gets past 30fps on lowest settings. This game was terribly optimised from the start and it hasn't been improved.    Erangel when it came out was a great map to play. Lots of fun, balanced. The same can't be said about all the maps and other stuff they've added to the game since then. There's a snow map where, if you don't get the thermal scope, you might as well just quit, because you will not win games against players who have it. They've added so much to the game that takes away from the pure battle royale formula. It truly feels like playing a mobile game on Steam.    Thirdly the players. Half are bots in your games, there are some hackers in the game, and then there are the people who never gave up on the game since it came out so they will completely destroy you with perfect aim, making the game very unfun. They had a solution to this, Casual Mode, but for some reason it's only third person, so unless you like peeking round corners with the camera, and having your opponents do the same to you, it's pretty much unplayable. There are 88 bots in Casual mode and the other 11 players spend their time driving around, doing nothing until the final few circles where they'll then play against players, because none of the bots know how to run into the safe zone. So your final 10 are full of people who just sweat the game, picking on casual players. Pretty unfun.    Another huge problem with the game is the amount of microtransactions forced down your throat. Blueballs Entertainment were pretty clear from the start of this games success that they only cared about the money and it's still the case today.    For any old players wondering whether to pick the game up again for nostalgia, save yourself the pain and just remember the good times, we all uninstalled this game for a reason, and that reason is still there today."

This game is in itself a lot of fun, although I do miss the broken mechanisms and more gritty feel of the alpha version back when it first came out. Currently, the game is still a classic and has managed to (mostly) maintain a very refreshing gritty and maximalist gaming experience in a sea of modern day hyper-saturated, kid friendly shooter games. This game is difficult and demanding, as some matches in the full-sized maps can take up to 30min+. I strongly recommend you play this game with a team of friends, in third person in one of the old full-sized maps (Erangel or Mira Mar). Aside from all the positives I've listed, I do wish this game remained true to its roots, instead of (in some ways) Fortnit-efying the game (emotes, skins, dances, colourful maps, etc). The game is truly at its best with little to no customisation, and gritty-feeling large maps."

Secondly my opinion, movement and sometimes vehicle mechanics in this game is really bad, sluggish and dated.  3. Third and most game breaking for me, is pvp engagements. especially having multiple amounts of players/teams in one area during a fire fight exchange, its more than apparent to me that the game doesn't handle this well at all. frames will drop massively, frame time will spike through the roof introducing lag like crazy and hit reg goes out the window. losing a large amount of fps is really irritating in a fire fight scenario and this has been a persistent problem of this game from day 1 and devs refuse to fix it or even acknowledge it.    4. We're now in 2025 and pubg still has 8.5hrs of downtime for maintenance windows. how not a single person in pubg's /karfton org have not developed or come up with a better solution than having an 8hr down time is incomprehensible. all these years gone by, WHY ARE WE STILL HAVING 8HRS OF DOWNTIME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS LATER???  ** Instead to trying to fix the netcode of this game, They'd rather throw out useless season passes with useless dances, car and player cosmetics. They seem to be more focused on capitalizing micro transactions rather than address and fix the major underlining game breaking problems for an enjoyable MP experience.   ** And don't even get me stared on players using exploits/cheating in various forms from auto snapping to targets and no recoil. its a joke and has been for years."

The game constantly crashes, often during intense moments, leading to a complete loss of progress and, of course, any chance of winning. The error message simply says, ""A PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS process has crashed!"" with no clear explanation or fix in sight.    I've tried everything—updating drivers, verifying game files, even reinstalling the game—but nothing seems to work. It's disappointing that a game this popular is still plagued by such severe issues. The developers need to prioritize stability; otherwise, what's the point of investing time and money into a game that doesn’t even run properly?     I can't recommend PUBG to anyone."

As a Care Bear, my main goal in life is spreading love and kindness, so I was a bit nervous about jumping into a battle royale like PUBG. But let me tell you, this game is so much more than just running around and causing chaos! For someone like me, who prefers to avoid fights and quietly hide in bushes until the final circles, PUBG is an absolute dream.  The graphics are stunning! Each map is like a beautiful, sprawling playground where I can explore and find the perfect hiding spots. The sound design is also top-notch—I can hear every rustling leaf and distant gunshot, which helps me stay out of trouble and sneak my way to safety.  What I love most about PUBG is how it caters to so many different playstyles. Whether you're a lone wolf on the hunt, a team player strategizing with friends, or a peaceful bear like me who just wants to stay out of sight, this game has something for everyone. The weapon physics are incredibly realistic, and while I don't engage in fights unless absolutely necessary, it's nice to know that when I do, the weapons handle so well.  Overall, PUBG is a wonderful experience for both the bold and the bashful. Whether you're looking to dominate the battlefield or just make it to the final circle without firing a shot, this game has you covered. Highly recommend for all kinds of players! 🐻✨"

Its still full of jank, and there will always be sweaty try-hards that send you packing to the lobby early, but that said, even after all these years, I have yet to encounter a game that can recreate the absolute adrenaline rush of a late-game showdown that this one does.

Nothing beats the thrill of spending 20 minutes hiding in a bathroom, only to step out and get sniped by someone who’s been camping on a hill the whole time. It’s a perfect mix of intense firefights and awkwardly running around in your underwear because you forgot to pick up pants. 10/10, would jump out of a perfectly good aeroplane just to get ambushed by a guy with frying pan again!"

Despite not being an amazing player, I've enjoyed the game immensely and have always played fairly. However, today I experienced something incredibly frustrating and unfair.  In the span of three games:  The first game, I got killed by blatant hackers. The second game was fine. In the third game, I received a 24-hour ban for ""cheats/hacks,"" despite never having cheated in my life. My Steam account is pristine and has been for years, yet I'm punished while actual cheaters run rampant. This is beyond disappointing and shows a severe flaw in the game's anti-cheat system. Legitimate players like myself are getting banned, while the real cheaters continue to ruin the experience for everyone else.  PUBG needs to seriously address this issue. Until then, I cannot recommend this game. If you value fair play and a good gaming experience, look elsewhere."

Sadly, since some time now, the developers are TOTALLY ignoring what gamers aske for and what they want.  As we all know, PUBG is OVER-FLOODED WITH CHEATERS, we were asking for the possibility to also play with bots (like in EVERY other game possible). -> The devs laugh, and start to add bunny costumes and weapon skins  Months later, we still ask for the possibilty to only play with friends and bots (like in EVERY other game possible). Many threads opened. Lots of eMails were sent. -> The devs laugh louder, give you condescending replies, and implement more bunny costumes and skins (nobody needs)  YEARS later, we still keep asking for Bot matches and bot matches with friends (like possible in EVERY other cheap game) -> Devs keep laughing, just implemented ""Casual games"" - where you can play against cheaters and many bots.   But... only 3x per day. Not as much as you want to. Why? Why not possible with Bots only? Why not with friends only vs Bots?? Why limited? Where is the sence?  -> [h3] Clear answer from an former pubg-employee:[/h3] Sorry to tell you, but its only to annoy you guys!

578080,171392375,1722736200,1,773,0.5,"I'm biased to this game because I've always enjoyed battle royales. I prefer Fortnite because I simply have more playtime, but this is a fairly entertaining game and definitely has nostalgic value to it now in 2024, at least to me. I enjoy the very detailed graphics. However, I find it very easy to fall off of playing this game consistently because the difficulty is subjectively harder to me. I enjoy the casual unranked mode and unlocking prizes. I believe this game would be much more enjoyable if you were to play often and purchase the battle pass (as with any other game).     One note- this games runs surprisingly smoothly still on my worn, low stress tolerance gaming laptop, so if you're looking for a moderately difficult battle royale, that isn't too hard to run on some older pcs/laptops, this is a place to start.    I understand this game is on the older side of battle royales, so I just never really participated in reviewing and I'm wanting to get back into engaging on the Steam platform!    subjective/problems i experience (not saying everyone will experience these)   - inaccurate/low quality/delayed sound effects  - steep learning curve, + people who still play tend to be relatively experienced    i am so down to squad up or become friends and chat with a more experienced player or a non experienced player on any game! i'm very friendly and love to nerd out about games"

I loved PUBG in it's glory days but now it's unplayable with 3 minute plus wait times and abundant hackers.

Because let's face it, if she played PUBG, the nation's security would probably be on another level!  PUBG is the ultimate training ground for dodging bullets, finding cover, and scavenging for the perfect gear—all skills that would make any Secret Service agent's heart race with fear. The game offers an intense mix of strategy and chaos, much like a day in the life of protecting high-profile figures, minus the actual life-or-death stakes. With every match, the director could practice her tactical decision-making skills and managing resources under pressure —because nothing says teamwork like screaming ""They're on the building! Get this camper!"" over voice chat.  So, if the director of the USA Secret Service ever decides to trade there suit for some digital camouflage, we can rest assured that PUBG has got them covered.  TLTR; It's not just a game; it's a training manual."

I've had so much fun with this game and although every time I get knocked down/out I may or may not get frustrated or take it personal I'm always ready to jump back in. It is pretty addicting. There is something to say about the cheating involved, most of the time the game is fair but once in a while there are individuals that are obviously cheating in some manner which is unfortunate but the game is fun apart from that. Updates are regular, weekly, I have not had an issue loading into games, longest wait time would be about 2-3 minutes, which isn't that long, sometimes the games are instant queues which is great. There was a time where games had a lot of bots in, Id finish the game with 10+ knock outs of bots but recently that isn't the case, which means there are more players which always makes the game more fun."

When I first started I had no idea what to do, even though the point is just to aim and shoot, I would still have a hard time. But after about 300 hours you start to have different approaches, tactics and gameplays. Study your enemies before engaging. After hours and hours of changing my tactics I started getting 1st place more frequently.    Don't give up on the first few tries, just keep at it, and it will pay off."

Used you be you'd see one in every 50 games who was obviously, now it's every other game you play and it gets worse every single season. Die to anyone in the game, look up their stats on one of the stat sites and it's either:-    -> Brand new account that's never played the game before on a 7k/d and 50%+ headshot rate  -> Account that's been dormant for 25+ seasons and suddenly playing again on a 50%+ headshot rate  -> Account that has 350 games played in the last 2 seasons with a 24k/d, 70% headshot rate and 1k average damage    Usually these are hacked accounts or a cheater who's been banned just making a new steam account to continue cheating because the game has literally no controls to stop this.     If it's not one of the above that kills you, it's someone from some internet cafe in China or Kosovo playing with 700+ ms who kills you from the future/past when you're 5 meters behind cover because the game has no ping or region lock. The developers are either complicit in cheating or are incompetent as to how to prevent it - and are too preoccupied making the worst cash shop known to man to milk money out of the whales still playing."

Have to find the same loot as others. It is a true test of skill rather than Kill Streaks or Pay To Win. I will always come back to play more when I feel like a quick game which then turns into 10 quick games lol

578080,170051646,1721181456,1,246934,0.5,"A great game since Beta with it's ups and downs like most games during their lifetimes since creation.  The original player's like myself put a lot of money into PUBG (paid game originally) with it's boxes and then the keys required we used to buy for cosmetic gears that we earned this way.  So I was glad when they moved away from this and into it's current format of a shop system for those wishing to spend real money and those like myself willing to grind!  I would also like to mention I personally think the price of each DLC that is released is more than fair price for the standard versions of each of these, if you have the time like myself to grind and not ""Pay to Play"" as many do.  My one and only major issue with PUBG since the start and now even worse than ever is the fact so many of you players in my gaming community now days feel the need to CHEAT!  Hackers have always been here but of late they are using less powerful Hacks to try not be discovered yet to me it seems TOO MANY PLAYERS are using them!  My suggestion is if you cannot play a game without CHEATS then perhaps find the game that suits your play style.  PUBG is an awesome game and now FREE so you cannot go wrong!  So Download now and ""Come at me Bro!"" before I head shot you with a Kar98 equipped with a 6 X scope from 840 meters away ;) (my current PB Sniper shot)"

Like a lot of these long-running live service games, there is a bunch of junk cosmetics in the game for you to buy that completely dilute and muddy the aesthetic and vibe of the game, to the point where every lobby looks like a insane asylum started a travelling circus.   No doubt you can still enjoy it with friends from time to time and the game is technically playable, its just so vanilla and where there are complexities they seem unnecessary or poorly thought out (like the healing items and system).   There is really nothing special about this game beside the fact that its the first game to popularize the genre.   I really don't think its worth getting into if you haven't already bought it."

From wall hacks and auto-aim to macros, I have had enough and am considering uninstalling the game entirely. The PUBG anti-cheat team is undoubtedly incompetent, and I now believe that PUBG is actually supporting these cheaters.    It is absurd how many cheaters are using wall hacks, and even those caught are only temporarily banned for a few days. There are no permanent bans. I am tired of PUBG's failure to implement a definitive solution. They have ruined our game, and it is now impossible to enjoy playing anymore.    Every time I log in, the enjoyment is sucked out by the rampant cheating, and the anti-cheat team’s incompetence only makes things worse. It is clear that they are either unwilling or unable to tackle the issue effectively. This lack of serious action against cheaters has made the game unbearable. I am done with PUBG."

You get killed if you get shot in the head, just like you would in real life. Fun stuff like driving cars a motobikes and flying gliders. Its hard to learn all the controls in the start, but its great once you have it. Now I mostly enjoy the team play in 4 man squad. Battle Royale gives you the ultimate chills, when you know the enemy is near circle is small and you win or die."

The half star docking would be mainly for the hackers that are constantly able to create new accounts and ruin the game with their toxicness. That said, I've spent over 4,000 hours on this game since it's arrival into the gaming world.

The player base now tends to have a lot of hackers with headshot mods which is infuriating!     The 3 match cap on casual matches is also horrendous as well as the skins and partners they've started getting, it almost feels like fortnite.     PUBG used to feel like an achievement to win but that's gone now, they've made it too easy to get high level gear. the weapon drops are overspawned now. You used to have to plan your drops to get high level gear and scavenge a lot, now you can be kitted in a single house. Part of the fun of this game was risking the high loot areas to die quickly or play it safe in the outskirts and hope you can get by.       I still play this game most days, but i think it's out of habit rather than entertainment."

Step 2: Preheat Your Oven Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). It’s important to preheat the oven so that your cookies bake evenly.  Step 3: Mix the Dough In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Add in the vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips (or other mix-ins).  Step 4: Shape the Cookies Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough and roll them into balls. Place the dough balls onto a lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. For chewy cookies, you can lightly flatten each dough ball with the palm of your hand.  Step 5: Bake Your Cookies Put the baking sheet into the preheated oven and bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may still appear slightly undercooked, but they will firm up as the cookies cool. Remember that baking time may vary depending on your oven and the size of your cookies, so keep an eye on them!  Step 6: Cool and Enjoy! Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool on the pan for a few minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, indulge in a taste of your freshly baked cookies! They pair perfectly with a glass of cold milk or a hot cup of coffee.  thank you for reading this whole recipe, do give me a like if you have found this useful :)"

From sneaking through fields of wheat like you're auditioning for 'The Sound of Music' to hiding in a bathroom stall praying the circle doesn't shrink around you, PUBG teaches you that survival is 90% luck and 10% pretending you know how to use a scope. Just remember, in PUBG, every match is a new chance to prove that yes, hiding in a bathtub can be a viable strategy against someone with an AK-47."

578080,168770539,1719917529,1,1354,0.5,"Title: PUBG - An Intense Battle Royale Experience    Rating: 4.5/5    PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) has solidified its place as a cornerstone in the battle royale genre since its launch. As a fan of multiplayer shooters, diving into PUBG was an exhilarating experience from the start.    Gameplay (5/5):  The core of PUBG lies in its intense gameplay. Dropping onto an island with 99 other players, the rush to scavenge for weapons, armor, and supplies creates palpable tension. Every move counts, whether you're creeping through buildings or sprinting across open fields. The dynamic circle system keeps matches dynamic, forcing constant movement and strategic positioning. Matches are a mix of heart-pounding firefights and nerve-wracking stealth, catering to different playstyles.    Graphics and Sound (4/5):  Visually, PUBG sets a realistic tone with detailed environments and character models. The landscapes are diverse, from dense forests to urban sprawls, adding variety to each match. However, occasional texture pop-ins and optimization issues can detract from the immersion. Sound design excels, with footsteps, gunfire, and vehicle engines providing crucial auditory cues, enhancing the tactical experience.    Community and Updates (4.5/5):  PUBG boasts a vibrant community, fostering competitive play and a thriving esports scene. Developer support has been commendable, consistently rolling out updates to address bugs, balance issues, and introduce new content like maps and gameplay modes. The introduction of seasonal passes and events keeps the community engaged, although occasional server instability during updates can be frustrating.    Conclusion:  PUBG stands out as a testament to the battle royale genre's potential. Its intense gameplay, strategic depth, and dynamic environments ensure every match is a unique experience. Despite minor technical hiccups, PUBG remains a must-play for enthusiasts of competitive multiplayer gaming.    If you're ready to drop into a world where survival is everything and victory is earned through skill and cunning, PUBG is the game for you."

Rape Main articles: Rape during the liberation of France and Rape during the occupation of Germany Secret wartime files made public only in 2006 reveal that American GIs committed 400 sexual offenses in Europe, including 126 rapes in England, between 1942 and 1945.[81] A study by Robert J. Lilly estimates that a total of 14,000 civilian women in England, France and Germany were raped by American GIs during World War II.[82][83] He estimates that there were around 3,500 rapes by American servicemen in France between June 1944 and the end of the war. Historian William Hitchcock states that sexual violence against women in liberated France was common.[84]  Human experimentation Main article: Unethical human experimentation in the United States The US military conducted experiments with chemical weapons like lewisite and mustard gas on Japanese American, Puerto Rican and African Americans in the US military in World War II to see how non-white races would react to being mustard gassed, with Rollin Edwards describing it as ""It felt like you were on fire, Guys started screaming and hollering and trying to break out. And then some of the guys fainted. And finally they opened the door and let us out, and the guys were just, they were in bad shape."" and ""It took all the skin off your hands. Your hands just rotted"". White soldiers were not experimented on.[85]  Bombing of North Korea Main article: Bombing of North Korea Wonsan under attack by B-26 bombers from the U.S. Air Force, 1951 The US bombing of North Korea during the Korean War has been condemned as a war crime by various authors. According to journalist Max Fisher, the U.S. bombing campaign ""often deliberately targeted civilian as well as military targets"".[89] Historian Bruce Cumings has likened the bombings to a genocide, stating, ""What hardly any Americans know or remember is that we carpet-bombed the north for three years with next to no concern for civilian casualties."" Author Blaine Harden has called the bombing campaign a ""major war crime.""[90][91]  A 2001 report by The Chosun Ilbo claims that approximately 282,000 North Korean civilians died during the bombing campaign, citing a report by Soviet ambassador to Korea V. N. Razuvaev.[100] General Curtis LeMay, who was head of the Strategic Air Command during the war, stated in an 1988 interview to Air Force historians that ""Over a period of three years or so we killed off, what, 20 percent of the population of Korea, as direct casualties of war or from starvation and exposure?""[101]   Vietnam War Original caption from Vietnam GI: The above picture (4 caucasian looking men posting for a photo with two decapitated body) shows exactly what the brass want you to do in the Nam. The reason for printing this picture is not to put down G.I.’s but rather to illustrate the fact that the Army can really fuck over your mind if you let it. It’s up to you, you can put in your time just trying to make it back in one piece or you can become a psycho like the Lifer (E-6) in the picture who really digs this kind of shit. It’s your choice.  RJ Rummel estimated that American forces killed around 5,500 people in democide between 1960 and 1972 in the Vietnam War, from a range of between 4,000 and 10,000.[105] Benjamin Valentino estimates 110,000–310,000 deaths as a ""possible case"" of ""counter-guerrilla mass killings"" by U.S. and South Vietnamese forces during the war.[106]  During the war, 95 U.S. Army personnel and 27 U.S. Marine Corps personnel were convicted by court-martial of the murder or manslaughter of Vietnamese.[107]: 33"

The anti-cheat system keeps getting better, making for a fairer experience. Each match tells a new story with unexpected twists. Just a heads up for new players: the learning curve for each weapon is steep, and the recoil can be pretty intense. But once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly rewarding. If you're into tactical shooters, PUBG is a must-try!"

What once was a gritty, intense survival battle royale has now devolved into an absurd carnival of pink bunny costumes and a rainbow atmosphere.  PUBG started with a clear vision: a realistic, high-stakes battle where survival depended on strategy and skill. The adrenaline rush of being the last one standing in a harsh environment was what drew me in. But now, that essence is completely lost.  The game is now a freak show, cluttered with bizarre, inappropriate content that clashes with its original spirit. Seeing players in garish pink bunny outfits feels like a slap in the face to those of us who cherished PUBG's realistic, survivalist roots. This whimsical, cartoonish aesthetic is not what I signed up for.  Moreover, the frequent collaborations with childish girl bands only make it worse. Instead of teaming up with brands that align with PUBG's intense atmosphere, the developers seem intent on chasing trends that have no place in a game that once prided itself on mature, brutal gameplay.  It's disheartening to see a game with so much potential lose its way so dramatically. The developers' focus on adding superficial content instead of enhancing the core gameplay experience is a huge misstep. PUBG no longer feels like the game I fell in love with; it feels like a cheap, desperate attempt to appeal to a broader audience.  Until the developers remember what made PUBG great—its authenticity, intensity, and true survival battle royale experience—it's hard to see a future for this game that doesn't involve more frustration and disappointment."

After weeks of unsuccessful attempts between the demonstrators and the Chinese government to find a peaceful resolution, the Chinese government declared martial law on the night of 3 June and deployed troops to occupy the square in what is referred to as the Tiananmen Square massacre. The events are sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement,[b] the Tiananmen Square Incident,[c] or the Tiananmen uprising.The protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country's future. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy that benefited some people but seriously disadvantaged others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge to its legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,[5] and restrictions on political participation. Although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied, the students called for things like rollback of the removal of ""iron rice bowl"" jobs, greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. Workers' protests were generally focused on inflation and the erosion of welfare. These groups united around anti-corruption demands, adjusting economic policies, and protecting social security.At the height of the protests, about one million people assembled in the square."

578080,167109566,1718049407,1,123441,0.5,"There are very few cheaters in this game. The reason a lot of people assume there are so many cheaters is due to the skill gap. Many of the players who play this game regularly have become very good at the game. And when people who aren't as good plays it, and encounter those players, they lack the skill to win against them, and often they can't take the fact that they are not as good as other players.  PUBG have done a lot to get rid of the hackers, and it is very noticeable. It is a fact that there were so many hackers back in the day (the days a lot of these reviewers refer to as the good old days with no hackers) where people flew around in cars, shot through hills and walls, and walked through walls and closed doors.   Now there are barely any cheaters left. Of course you may encounter one every once in a while, like one in 30 games. But usually those people are extreme noobs who barely even know how to use the cheat anyways, so you end up killing them.  The people who leave reviews claiming the games are filled with cheaters, are just lacking the skill. And there is NOTHING wrong with lacking skill! You will improve your skills by keep playing the game and not giving up. Realize and accept that there is a skill gap, and that you are not as good as many other players, and keep playing and improving instead of crying and make false statements to try and feel good about yourself for being bad at the game."

Now you can revive teammates (with lots of noise and a spawn delay) but it's been fun to jump back in. There can be a lot of bots in matches but at least they give you some target practice and fill out the map. Overall, would ask the boys, ""where we dropping'?"" again."

578080,166955091,1717870839,0,36799,0.5,"I bought this back in 2017 when it first came out. I have, as of this writing, 613 hours into it...I haven't played since 2021 or so, and when I jumped back in, I have to go through training scenarios as if I've never played before. Okay, whatever. It's a minor 4 minute inconvenience.     However, with 613 hours under my belt in this game, I can't play ranked, and am forced to play in bot lobbies. In my second round back after 2 years, and after getting my ass handed to me since 2017, I got a chicken dinner. My second to last kill jumped outside a window firing into the wall, and the final kill laid down in front of me and didn't even fire the weapon. Wow. That's good gameplay.    I don't know what's going on with this game, or how they match players, but it's a slap in the face to give a guy with 613 hours into the game nothing but bot lobbies as if I'm a 12 year old coming out of CoD for the first time. Frankly, it's a slap in the face to give any player new or old, lobbies with bots. This isn't the challenging game they released in 2017 where you could easily jump in and play against other people and be challenged to get better. It's now an overly-complicated interface meant to get you to spend money on skins, and a joke of a game that seems to be riddled with easy bots instead of actual players.    Killing bots isn't fun. Killing bots isn't satisfying. I'd rather be killed by bad players, than get easy bot kills. Wondering if I killed a bot or a player, isn't something I'm interested in. I'm wildly disappointed in how they seemed to have ruined such a good game.     I have a lot of good memories from this game, but I can't imagine making any more in the future."

In the devs defense, getting Live service right ins't easy. With so much competition, it is hard to compete within the prestige market. Carving out a niche, or catering to different demographics may be the only way this game has survived as long as it has in this overinflated market. Its a shame it appears to have come at the loss of pliability and quality."

Ingredients:  1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie  Directions:  1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Looks absolutely horrendous (graphicaly) MMR is the worst in any game I have ever played. Feels like I play against pros ever damn game and can't win a single fight nowadays. During the peak PUBG days I remember the matches where always fair and there was a wide range of skill in each lobby but now it's not the same.   TLDR: Used to be good back when it came out and enjoyed it until ca 2021. Then everytime I come back to it I leave it disappointed. Don't play it unless you already have alot of experience. Feels like all the bad things still are bad and for people who don't have 3K hours it is impossible to get a a fair lobby or fight.   Back in 2018: 8/10   Now: 4/10

Con i primi non puoi nemmeno provare a giocare in quanto chi scripta / usa cheat sui giochi è imbattibile senza se e senza ma; con i secondi è come provare a giocare a calcio 1v1 contro Messi; con gli ultimi è ancora più frustrante perchè nonostante siano nettamente più scarsi comunque ti uccideranno senza problemi perchè non li vedi e non li senti fino a quando sei già morto.  La maggior parte delle kill che otterrete saranno su finti player (BOT) che vanno in giro per la mappa.  Pur settando il gioco al meglio con più fps , una connessione in fibra, un mouse/tappetino/tastiera molto buoni , esperienza negli FPS (come CS:GO e simili dove il rinculo conta), sens del mouse + sens in game simile ai ""pro"" del gioco stesso, esercizi di spray control + DM e prove varie (circa 500 ore), vedrete che comunque faticherete a tenere la mira come vorreste , mentre dall'altra parte troverete SEMPRE persone (anche di livelli bassi) che controllano in modo  P E R F E T T O il rinculo dell'arma senza problemi dove entreranno i primi 2/3 colpi su testa/collo (si anche meglio di come vedete fare ai giocatori professionisti nelle varie competizioni o nelle loro stesse stream). Ingiocabile, inproponibile, intankabile. Vedere da streamer della fluidità dei movimenti assurda, anche solo il movimento destra-sinistra viene fatto in modo velocissimo, copiando le loro impostazioni, riprovando a fare le stesse cose non verrà mai allo stesso modo, perchè ""legalmente"" non è fattibile senza aiuti esterni. Situazione disgustosa. La pazienza è stata tanta , come le prove fatte per migliorare mira, impostazioni, assegnazione tasti, ""allenamenti"" etc etc.. Disistallato ! Non consiglio a nessuno di giocare al gioco, non ne vale la pena, nemmeno spendendo ore e ore nel migliorare comunque le lobby si presenteranno come descritte sopra. Piuttosto che provare questo gioco e spendere tempo a migliorarsi consiglio vivamente di provare qualsiasi altra cosa."

Bought the game in 2018 and it was a buggy and clunky mess. Still the most fun I've ever had in a team based competitive shooter. Enjoyed making formations with my team, the recoil and bullet-drop physics. Felt realistic compared to other shooters I loved. Then Apex Legends released and I enjoyed that much more.  • PUBG is still a very fun game and is extremely rewarding to learn • New content is released often • Still a large player base; good balance of helpful players and malicious trolls • You can now play easier BR games against bots and enjoy different game types • Very clunky feeling movement compared to other shooters • Still a buggy mess sometimes"

This game is so close to being good but the devs seem hell bent on  keeping it a trash experience by not fixing simple shit. F U devs.

Or able to pick you off from long range on a fully auto weapon with no recoil. I think Fortnight would be a better game than this dumpster

The Erangel Classic feels pretty good, makes the game feel like I remember and doesn't feel so insurmountable but its only on for another week so I probably won't play past that.   Also I noticed coming back you no longer get items in chests you get imprints which you then have to grind materials to make the item, so it used to be, grind for a chest and key get an item, not its grind for a chest and key, get an imprint, now grind more chests and keys to get more imprints to deconstruct to get materials to them build your imprint, with higher rarity imprints requiring more materials it feels so much more grindy than it needs to be pushing you towards spending money on items instead.   Feels a shame the game is so far from what I remember. and not in a good way."

I used to play for hours with friends finding every match a thrilling time that often had us talking about how we could have won or did win even after the fact. Unfortunately those days are long gone. Over the last couple years the game has been about making money rather than offering an enjoyable experience. This started when the game's original devs sold the title and ever since that dollar sign looms ever bigger. I tried getting back into it a few times but ended up finding the bots mode more enjoyable than a regular match. Finally, the new privacy policy they've put out is just downright intrusive. For me, that's probably the last nail in the coffin for PUBG. There are other more promising titles for the BR genre and even some Like Hunt: Showdown that mix genres between a BR and extraction shooter. I really wish I could recommend this game as I have fond memories but the FTP mess just isn't worth the time.  Side Note: This game also maxes my system frequently for no reason. I've by no means got a low end PC and the settings I ran in PUBG were pretty modest so not entirely sure what's going on with that."

I can play in 4k.  Maps are huge, fun.  Sounds are good.   Bad:  The entire UI is now an indecipherable labrynth of premium currency unlocks. bonus passes and misleading unlocks that appear to grant you things you must unlock with cash based currency.  Deathmatch mode is both janky and unsatisfying.  Its basically Fortnite without the cartoony aspect."

However, they need to do something about the cheaters, smurfing and straight up textures blocking you or making your vehicle crash like its 2002. If they really do update to UR5 this year, and use that opportunity to implement a better anti-cheat without a 2-click bypass and consider removing the plague that is ""skill-based matchmaking"", then they have a solid game built on an even more solid foundation. this game has potential to be better than anything currently out, but needs hefty updates.

When the framerate drops from 130 to 60, the game becomes unresponsive and the input lags, rendering it impossible to have any control over the camera or your character.  When you leave a match, rarely the game goes back to the menu. It is more common that it will just soft lock itself into a nice-looking background image. (yes, it wasn't loading, I checked.)  I'm sorry for the developers working on this, I can imagine there are good and competent professionals on the team, but somehow, even with the the huge pile of money this game was able to make, it is still a buggy, janky and unpleasant game. I had fun playing it back when it was released, but the magic worn out and now the lack of quality of this game is more visible than ever.  The art direction and visuals are fine."

I move from behind the tree to crest the hill on what should be behind him to his right...but no, I'm instantly headshot.  Watch the kill cam, dude's brazenly watching us all through walls, the hill, etc. and downed the 2nd teammate and I in one hit. It's revenue, though, so I doubt this crap will ever be looked into.

Instead of focusing on the aforementioned issues and overall gameplay, the developers chose to pursue skins and other crap they use to fleece the players out of their money.  They have shown that gameplay, i.e. the players actually having fun is a very distant second to money, which is further evidenced by their inane privacy policy.  I paid for this game years ago and now I can't play it without forfeiting my personal information which isn't even required to play the game because these greedy developers want to cash in on that too.

578080,165260705,1715567949,0,8220,0.5,"There's so many reasons why to NOT waste your time playing this trash excuse for a game.    First off: CHEATERS  -If you thought Escape from Tarkov had a bad cheating reputation, then you've seen nothing yet.  I on average come across at least one cheater EVERY GAME.    Next, who wants to waste 30-45 minutes of their life playing the slowest BR there is, with a 10 year old engine and terrible graphics and gun physics?      Let's be honest, the only reason you play this is because you can't run newer games and/or just for the memories of PUBG.      Finally: BOTS  -There's tons of them in the game, i'd say on average at least 50% of the lobby is a bot that is easier to kill than stepping on a crippled spider.      If you ask me, I'd rather play Call of Duty Warzone and that's saying alot.  This game was fun in 2014 but now, I don't know why anyone would selectively play it.  Just better off watching Jersey Shore tbh"

578080,164959175,1715217458,1,17207,0.5,An unpolished gem.
578080,164956099,1715213267,1,2322,0.5,its the best shooting game ever
578080,164954977,1715211867,1,126144,0.519230782985687256,"I mean it's alright   The game has changed a lot since I bought it when it first came out, some things for the better, others not so much.  The game naturally had an increase in cheating when it became FTP, which kinda ruins it.  One thing that hasn't really changed is how poorly optimized this game was/still is. I mean its FTP but also at the same time PTW if you catch my drift.  It's a lot of fun with a squad of friends, or even randoms, however, single player is basically a horror game at times.  The menu/lobby/IO/UI is some of the most convoluted and confusing things i've ever seen in this type of game. You have 10 different currencies, 5 different crafting methods, you have to ""craft"" items you’ve unboxed, some of which can be ungodly expensive (but at the same time cheap as it's free in game currencies) and the currency you can buy (G-coin) can sometimes ""expire""... The match replay system is also borderline unusable. Death cams can be janky as hell, which makes distinguishing between legit and suspicious gameplay hard.  The matchmaking system is kind of a mixed bag, and you have a lot of different game modes to choose from. Long queue times at off hours are a problem, and these matches are usually filled with bots. You can not choose which map you want to play either, which is a bummer in my opinion. I, as a lot of others, have pretty strong opinions on which maps we like, and which less so. The skill/rank system is also pretty hit or miss. You can easily be matched against a lvl. 500 master prestige player when you've just started playing (this is for normal BR at least). Weapon balancing also isn't perfect.  You can experience some weird/annoying shit in this game from time to time, such as, but not limited to, crazy vehicle physics, weird parachute physics and parameters, random fall damage (amount of damage too), random lag spikes and game crashes, weird background system usage, loading times, and heavily client sided gameplay.   All in all, it's fun when it's fun and when it isn't, it really isn't.  It's a textbook battle royale game. Looting, shooting, and a lot, and I do mean A LOT of running.    Chicken dinners do taste good though."

578080,164687571,1714996461,1,131735,0.5,"Improvement points:    Performance -  There are issues with stutter for a lot of players. It tends to happen during gunplay, which is less than ideal. For a visually underwhelming game, there's a lot of performance overhead that could be addressed through better rendering methods/optimisation tech.    Loot boxes -  The loot box system is predatory. The usage of clearable notifications for rewards, multiple click-intensive reward streams, and ""pay more to win less"" is a master class on how to hook people into a gambling addiction. The UI may be complained of here, but it's designed deliberately, to increase time spent in the gambling system.    Cheating -  A lot of cheaters are banned every week in PUBG. The game design lends itself to cheating, with a lot of advantage given to ESP, aim/recoil assist, and automated movement. This is an obviously complicated issue to resolve, but also one that leaves you wondering ""was that real?"", which can be frustrating.    Matchmaking -  The matchmaking system is not transparent to players. The amount of bots in a match, the server connected to, and the behaviour of the matchmaking system are entirely unclear. An example - my squad [mix of EU/NA players] tends to encounter more cheaters, high ping opponents, and high level players if the NA players act as host. When EU players are hosting, the matchmaking appears to pool us with more reasonably similar players.    The good parts:    The game is unreasonably fun, and has a strong balance.  Gunplay has a strong learning curve, and positioning/map knowledge is heavily rewarded. The game embodies the idea of small improvements adding up. You can't simply 'get good'. You have to analyse your performance and work on the areas that you're most struggling with. This game has been desperate to become a respected e-sport for a long time. In many ways, it struggles to do that, as the game loop attempts to meet the desires of both casual and serious players. But over time, the game seems to have been figuring its identity out and becoming a joy in the BR genre."

578080,163731891,1714256141,1,115848,0.5,I always come back to pubg .. It's got something .. not sure how to describe it.
578080,163730829,1714254985,1,6318,0.5,"PUBG, the ultimate battle royale showdown where even the toughest players can get taken out by a sweaty level 500. It's like the game knows when you're feeling confident and decides to humble you with a swift defeat.  Picture this: you're creeping through the grass, thinking you're the sneakiest player alive, when suddenly, BAM! You're sniped by someone who probably has their own theme music playing in the background.  Sure, PUBG's got its thrills, but it's those moments of frustration that really make you question your life choices. Who knew a virtual frying pan could be so infuriating?  But hey, despite the rage-inducing moments, PUBG keeps you coming back for more punishment. It's like a dysfunctional relationship you just can't quit. So, grab your bandages, load up on energy drinks, and get ready for a wild ride of laughs, tears, and maybe a few expletives thrown in for good measure. PUBG, where the only thing more unpredictable than the circle closing in is your own sanity."

Was ok to start with in season 28... but Season 29.. So many hackers. You can report, submit an email, all the proof.. all they get is a ""Unusual Game Play"" - 24 Hour Ban.. then come back and continue using the same hacks.. get another 24 hour ban.  Its clear the Anti Cheat is a complete failure, it cant detect anything.. In-game reports are mostly ignored. The 100k weekly ban lists are probably bogus   Game is fun, however hackers quickly ruin it and Krafton do not care as clearly shown by their 24 hour Temp bans even after hacker has been banned multiple times in the past for the same damn thing.  Dont waste your time.. find another game"

578080,163595702,1714098057,1,70795,0.5,"So lets say you consider yourself a reasonable person, a peaceful person, possibly even, a placid person. Others may typically describe you as the sort of person that ""Plays well with others""  Well then, I have the game for you. PUBG!  This game will subdue, suppress, push all those ""John Smith"" sensibilities deep down and allow the ""other"" parts of your personality to flourish. The parts that are normally reserved for parents/teachers/caretakers  trying to herd children into a vehicle when your already late to insert ""important event"" here.  Shakespeare was renowned for inventing words that are so commonplace now in the English language that we often forget to attribute them to him. PUBG continues in this tradition and makes people do this everyday.   If only someone would write these wonderful expressions down for longevity.     PUBG 11/10 will swear inappropriately at any hour of the day"

The blue is absolutely terrible, makes the experience a mess (developers still don't understand that is not why people like pubg). When we fought good enough to reach the top 10, we can't have a real strategy because the blue is pushing too hard. Dying in a few sec when playing for 25 min is just non sense, Of course it happens when there are only real and good players left, which is the best time to fight! what a game! I will stop playing it after 659 hours (season2). Transportation is also (always be) an issue, sometimes we have to run in fields 80% of the time, no cars, nothing. all in all I really regret the good old pubg ambiance.

Bullet physics are excelent and vary a lot from weapon to weapon. Util is realistic, vehicles are valuable, you really benefit from knowing the map and terrain. On the bad side, it has a lot of input lag and game works like shit. If you play on a normal ping say 50~ and you play against people with >10 you have no chance. Its pure bullshit where sometimes you see yourself hitting them and seeing the blood coming out, only to find out damage didnt register when they knock you out. Also, you are gonna get knocked when you are allready behind cover, will have some lost bullets that go nowhere and all that shit, as this are all server sided calculations. On top of all that, game is very badly optimized and much more demanding than you would think according to its graphics. Game will take 100% of your cpu but will use 40 to 50% of your gpu, which makes no sense. Aaaand lets not forget the constant cheaters on all servers and all levels. Trust me on all this, i ve wasted 2k+ hours and its really not worth it."

Now it's only fun 1 in every 20 matches when by some freak chance there's only bots playing. Do yourself a favour and listen to all the negative comments and go play anything else. Even CSGO has less cheaters and that's saying something...  Edit: Still nothing is being done about the hackers.

I only recently started playing it again after a near 4 year hiatus if not 5, and I will say that a lot of the early game issues have been resolved. Hacking is still there, of course but I don't see it as often, and I quite enjoy the 3/3 Casual Games you get to play each day as a warm up since most of them are bots. Playerbase is currently pretty good and the amount of currencies in this game may just drive you inside: Tickets, G-Coin, BP, Event Tickets, Workshop Credits, etc. But overall there's plenty of ways to get gear for FREE just by playing the game. I would recommend this, or at least trying it out since it's F2P now. As for the graphics I find it to be much more optimized than it has been in years past, I get easily 80 frames on higher settings with a 1080 Ti. Once it moves over to Unreal Engine 5, I suppose we'll see."

578080,162407147,1712491608,1,14256,0.5,"It had a downward spiral there for a while, however, currently I would recommend the game again. They have done a lot of work to make this worth playing again."
578080,162404340,1712488501,1,2341,0.5,"Even thought it is now way past it's prime, PUBG is still insanely fun, solo or with friends.     It's easy to learn and very, very hard to master. You could argue the maps are a bit too big, and the gameplay can be slow at times, essentially being a walking simulator, but honestly it makes sense for a game like this. It tries it's best to be realistic, at least in these aspects, so I can't fault the game for that. The gameplay, the way that weapons work and the movement are all great, honestly.     Only thing for sure I don't like, or I guess I should say don't care for, are the lootboxes, and the attempts to make the battlepasses and other in-game cosmetics seem much more important than they are. Luckily there is no pay-to-win aspect in all of it.    All in all, this game was great, still is great, definitely recommend if you have the time."

The pre waiting-area splash screen will sometimes freeze and then they will penalise you from quitting the round early when you were never given the opportunity to actually load into the waiting area at all. This game is an exercise in utter frustration. I bought this rubbish in early access and have never liked it."

578080,162294293,1712358021,0,81760,0.5,"My biggest love-hate relationship with a video game. There's nothing like winning games with minimal gear, getting out of seemingly impossible situations with your buddies and walking away with a chicken dinner. This game has some of the best core gameplay out of any PvP game I've ever played. We've done insane things in this game and I'm proud we were able to work together for a win.  In the same breath this game is 7 years old and still a clunky mess. To celebrate, when you start a match there's 7 balloons that should be interpreted as Ls instead of 7s with the direction this game has gone. They have tried appealing to the more casual playerbase with things such as blue zone grenades and blue chip transmitters. It doesn't matter where you land anymore as you can get fully kitted from anywhere instead of having to drop hot. It used to feel like winning the lottery to find a bolt-action rifle and an 8x scope, now you can expect to get at least one of your preferred weapons early on. An increase in loot from early game was fine but it's way too easy in the current state to get fully kitted.    PUBG is also pretending ping locks don't exist and patting themselves on the back after implementing region locks which were circumvented 14 seconds after implementation by a cool little thing called a VPN. Then they post their weekly bans as if those people aren't still playing under new names. Cheaters do not get punished in a free game. They can do what they want and if they get banned they immediately move to another account that's ready to go. Some regions have unhealthy playerbases because PUBG has driven away people who are getting tired of second place finishes to low level players with obvious CN names. But instead of focusing on that PUBG would rather have 62 different currencies and K-pop skins.   I will change my review when PUBG is in a healthy state (lol)  Update: You can't even play an arcade lab mode (to test new features such as aim punch) without cheaters. This game is cooked."

578080,162280454,1712343674,1,83351,0.468262195587158203,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a masterpiece in the realm of battle royale games. From the moment you step into its world, you're immersed in an adrenaline-fueled experience like no other.  The graphics are stunning, creating an immersive environment that truly makes you feel like you're stranded on a remote island. The variety of landscapes, from dense forests to abandoned cities, ensures that no two games are alike.  But what truly sets PUBG apart is the ever-rising tension with every passing second. The feeling that every step you take could mean life or death adds an intensity rarely found elsewhere. The need to constantly stay vigilant while strategically planning your next move makes PUBG a true test of your senses.  The array of weapons and equipment offers countless opportunities to find your own playstyle and adapt to the situation. Whether you prefer an aggressive approach or prefer to lay low and strike at the opportune moment, the choice is yours.  Furthermore, PUBG is a game that is constantly evolving. The developers are always striving to enhance the player experience and introduce new content, meaning there's always something new to discover.  Overall, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a must-play for anyone craving the thrill and excitement of a real survival challenge. Sharpen your senses, hone your reflexes, and dive into this epic adventure—you won't regret it!"

Worst thing this game ever did was go free to play. Bans should be IP bans. Nothing is stopping these lowlifes from making another free account and cheating again. Sucks because it ruins the fun for the people who enjoy the game. Save yourself from the torment and play something else. One day the developers might get a hold of how to handle the hacking, but probably not before they strip your wallet for the in store goods that are absurdly overpriced."

578080,162028753,1712066700,1,28502,0.786537647247314453,"PUBG is one of my favorite games to of all time. So Ill list out what I like and dont like for anyone new or wanting to get back into it.    PROS     - [GAME PLAY] I love the weight of the equipment, cars, movement and just the over all feel of the game is something that always draws me to it over other titles. Getting an elimination in PUBG feels infinetly more rewarding compared to other shooting titles I've played. I think its due to the fact its not really the easiest mechanically to control the character/gun and the strategy alone required in a big open map to successfully elim other teams makes the payoff feel huge.    - [SOCIAL] The Friends who are able to tolerate sucking at the beginning of playing this game I can guarantee you will be some of the best friends you can ever make because if they can Enjoy PUBG without having to win every game they are typically very down to earth people who enjoy the process of things more than the flashy winning titles and made up accolades (besides Steam Acheivements those are very important)    - [COSMETICS] As someone who loved H1Z1's customization and would spend hours manipulating the market to afford 30 cent items I can easily say PUBG is just as good. If you don't want to be a Kpop star thats fine I guess.. you can be literally customize to whatever you want to wear whether thats Apocalytpic/steam punk gear, designer fashion wear, Jeremy Lin for some reason, or you can be a giant polar bear. All cosmetics are pretty cheap or easily earned through Contraband boxes. All my skins are from twitch drops and contraband and my inventory is lookin nice.       CONS     - [BOTS] There are AI players that fill up lobby's to make sure you don't ride on empty planes. They arn't too annoying at first until you have had to figure out the shooting you have heard for 5 mins is two bots battling to the death missing every shot. They dont feel too rewarding to elim and dont actually carry useful loot other than the bullets you used to take them out.    - [DARK SIDE OF SOCIAL] A lot of the time people who play this game are closeted Mil Sim enjoyers who think they are legit on deployment siege-ing the fields of a foreign country sitting on top of Oil reserves. Literally if you take away anything from this post Don't pay these people any attention they are very controlling in their game plan. Best advice is when they get knocked out you can see their true nature come out as they screamed to be revived as if they legit got shot.     - [LEARNING CURVE] This isn't really a con but be prepared to deploy the parachute and land late, loot all game and see no one then get shot in the back for many many games... As someone who loves games like Firewatch just pretend that its going to be a lot of exploration for sometime. You wont know where to look or where to be but over time things come naturally just always make sure above all else to have fun when trying to learn.     Thanks for reading I hope this helps!"

I paid full price when this game came out. Since becoming free it has become a haven for super obvious hackers. KRAFTON and it's co owners say that they care about my gaming experience and do have a reporting system for when you believe you encounter a cheater. But, and this is a big but (no pun intended).  They issue temporary bans far more than they do permanent bans. Also, the hackers just get another of their many STEAM accounts and start all over again without missing a beat.  My feeling is THIS GAME SHOULD NOT BE FREE. Forcing the cheaters to pay every time an honest player gets a permanent ban against a cheater. Otherwise they will just continue to cheat and there is nothing the honest player can do to effect this situation. Until this happens i see no reason to play a game where winning is impossible 90% of the time. I would be happy to change this review if this was the case."

I have been playing this game since December 2018 but not as a regular gamer because of full-time responsibilities. It helps us make a huge community and we cherish some amazing moments together over the years. The gunplay is the most realistic and demanding feature of the game and most of the players are still unable to reach the ceiling, so they have moved on to some easier games. I do not blame them because games must be entertaining and fun but playing this game gave me some of the of the funniest moments of my life in games and I can't thank enough the developers for the same.  It should be noted that this game evolved a lot in the last seven years and it was bad and broken in the early years but some players stood by it and gave their opinion via various channels and it was heard and implemented gradually, which made it more intense and fun at the same time. I am not proficient yet but above average and don't get bored even if you have a bad day because when it offers fruits, you can't just stop dominating.  There is still room for improvement but given the time of seven years and the player base still stuck at 600,000+, whereas it was pronouced dead by many renouned players, I am very proud of the people behind the scenes who made this possible.  Thank you, and I recommend it to all the players who played shooting games."

578080,161549592,1711501218,0,11418,0.5,I use to be addicted to this game. So when my friends suggested we try it out again I was very enthusiastic to give it a go. The first two games we played went off without a hitch. Then a week later we hopped back on eager to keep going and we started noticing that players were hitting almost impossible shots. Performing full 180s without sound queues and locking onto things that weren't even there to the normal eye. It has become riddled with cheaters. If I had to guess the game is about 75% cheaters and 20% not real players. I have 3 clips where a player is looking in the opposite direction and auto locks onto a player and then snaps auto locks to another player. I see them posting about removing players and issuing bans but it does not seem to be doing anything. If you plan on picking up PUBG again just be aware that it is riddled with cheaters.

Please make it possible to choose the map you want to play on and make more items for purchase/sale on steam.  The crafting system is completely random and useless.

I love this game but i hate to see that monetization and sponsorships are more important than optimization and user experience. I dealt with it for years 6 years because the highs of playing this game can be some of the best in gaming ever but the lows of the hackers, crashing/ stutters, and the shop shoved in my face are too much to bear at this point. Unfortunately i think im done with pubg :(  P.S. the steam version does not run much better than xbox so the performance criticism applies to this version as well."

As someone who played when this game first launched its worse than before its that bad. the actual gameplay of Pubg is fun but not when you get queued against the Shroud wannabees after playing in nothing but bot lobbies, why are there even bots in this game (trying to copy fortnite) the loot is plentiful and think that be great but when everyone gets lvl 2 gear with weapon and attachments that are everywhere there is no risk, no reward. But don't worry they have the item shop always up and working, refreshing Overall it is really not worth checking out even just to see what its like now, its very disappointing to say the least, also after all these years, the game still crashes ;)"

This game consumed me for many many months while I was in university and the lack of good anti-cheat system is bewildering. They release weekly updates on thousands of accounts that get banned and IP addresses that also get banned, but we still see that cheating goes rampant in this game.  The new system of rotating the maps seems like a good idea but its restricting as 70% of the the time we still just play the original map. DONT GET ME WRONG, OG IS BEST BUT.... I don't ONLY wanna play that when there are over than 7 maps created which allow for a lot more diversity.  But let me finish strong. the game jsut isn't what it used to be at launch. It went downhill ever since then, new BRs came out and PUBG just lagged behind in content without bringing anything new out that was creative. They sat on the ""realism"" of the gunplay and then just never expanded on the game. Also, don't forget about the kids who never went outside to touch grass and have been playing for the last 5 years and just instantly laser beam you from the other side of the map without any ability to counterplay.  EDIT, why'd they remove controller support for all of you? This developer is wild but I agree with the K&M only style of gameplay. Y'all need to goto back to Fortnite. Stop whining.  I love and hate this game. Goodnight  TLDR; Game never got better, its fun for the first couple drops and then just never gets better."

And the excessive meat riding the Devs do to the Koreans. It has now become the warthunder of BR's, in which you fucking hate the game, but for some reason seem to come back, thinking of the good old times, only to have your shit kicked in by some sweat grinding this game like it's his boyfriends dick. There are still some good parts of the game, but those that are, usually are regulated and only allow you to play for a short amount of time before you are forced to play with bitches once again. I only recommend if you like games that are fun for a small amount of time."

Also, still not properly optimized(better now, not perfect) When reporting cheaters, i don't think they even ban people. SHAME,SHAME...... Cheaters even reach 500 levels, this shows they(PuBg) dont care!!!    There's not much to say, it's a really cool game, even after all these years. But it's a pity/shame that cheating/hacking is allowed in PuBg, which is very frustrating and unfair to ordinary players, sometimes it's impossible to enjoy this game! so many people are turning away from PUBG. I spend about $500  just to play with cheaters."

578080,159885547,1709615423,0,36858,0.5,This game was good when it came out but not now.. its full of hackers and way to many items in the game. Just a cluttered mess. By the time i get a decent set of gear i get sniped or run over. Its very difficult I wish they had a mode of beginners or a mode where it matched you up with similar skilled players. I'm not very good at this game and its hard to get better when you get killed before you know what happened to you. I don't recommend this game.
578080,159884426,1709613547,1,69719,0.5,"Very Inconsistent experience like no match is ever the same. Yes there are plenty of cheaters but every game is suffering from that at the moment and this allows you to take the game less seriously while still trying to get better at the game if you're putting hours in. PUBGreport.com shows you killing or getting killed by streamers which makes things a bit interesting. There are tons of new players coming in and it's worth a try of course with the game being free, but it's a steep learning curve especially with no battle royale experience. Physics are weighty but using vehicles are a fun enough experience in itself."

578080,159857656,1709577083,0,21634,0.523809552192687988,"Когда я впервые увидел умственно отсталых детей, я очень переживал: как они приживутся в этом сложном мире, как они найдут свое призвание в жизни, кем будут работать, будут ли они вообще зарабатывать своими бедными ручками на хлеб? Годы шли, я становился старше и уже будто позабыл о тех детках. Я учился, развивался, работал. В детстве я очень любил компьютерные игры, особенно шутеры, и всегда хотел попробовать что-то новое. Мне в 18м году все чаще начали попадаться видео , где люди счастливые играют в новую игру! Через некоторое время, убедив себя потратить деньги, со скрежетом на сердце, я решился купить именно эту игру. И тут я понял, вот оно- то о что во мне вызвало такие сильные эмоции... Я нашел этих детей даунят, что , как показывалось в передаче по телевизору, не могли различать цвета, не могли даже дойти из одной точки в другую и мочились под себя. Я был счастлив: эти дети выросли и стали разработчиками этой игры. Ведь такую величайшую , развитую, многостороннюю , с прекрасным нэткодом и ещё более лучшей регистрацией попаданий могли придумать только такие дети даунята. Я и по сей день захожу в эту игру с друзьями , тратя на вход в общей сложности по 10 минут, и поддерживаю этих ребят, ведь , сочувствуя им, я их полюбил по своему, как они ссались себе на лицо, как размазывал фекалии по телам друг друга, как захлебывались своей слюной и бились головой о любые рядом стоящие объекты. Это игра так похожа на их жизненный путь - вниз. И это великая метафора от них, они оставили свою подпись в книге жизни, ведь вниз- на английском означает down.  Удачи в следующих свершениях этой команды даунов-разработчиков, гейм дизайнеров, директоров и прочих выходцев домов малютки и интернатов! 10 пакетлосов из 10"

578080,159590254,1709275444,0,3033,0.5,"I am a long time Pubg player. Started off with mobile and have had my moments along with my friends. Wont say was a pro league level player but i knew i could hold the ground and win most of the challenges thrown at me. 2018 to 2020 were core days for me with continues wins and a lot of fun(Pubg Mobile). We have had also bought rp so that proves how much addicted we were to this game.  That said, tried Pubg PC for the first time some years ago and it was straight off obvious that this game was not for the fragile ones. It was more challenging, the recoil was wayy harder to control, everything should be manually sort out and overall the gaming experience was very different and hard. Even though on the core both are the same game but Pc was different in a lot of other ways. Anyway, we let go of PUBG PC the first day itself claiming this game was not playable   (we were Kids back then).  Came back during covid and started playing this because we were already well addicted to Rainbow six siege and some other games so wanted to try something new. Some of my friends even bought the game. We tried playing it, had some good luck but the game was filled with high level players. On top of the highly stressful recoil and shit movement, now we had to face players who have had their time to train and knows their way around. It was pretty frustrating to us because in mobile, if we managed to be good trained players, it was only because we had our time to train as noobies and we fought bots and other noobs like us back in the day until we level'ed up eventually and started being competent.   Later realized that in pc we were getting matched with high level players because the player base went down (Obviously lol)  Why wont it? On top of the already stressful gameplay, now we gotta face lvl 400? And we are like what, lvl 10?  Decided to stop it again after getting thrashed by lvl 400's. At this point we were just looting bags for them. We get down, loot till the last time mark and then get our butts whopped. All for what? Pubg appointing us to be the loot for those players. Trust me, that was what we were.   Current day- decided to give the game one more shot because why not? We have had soo many memories and nostalgia in this game(Pubg Mobile) not PC. We had returned to mobile between all of this for a brief period and quit but mobile was always fun. At this point everyone had a good pc so no one really played mobile. So decided to give pc one last try, and guess what? The game is still horrible, lol who would have thought?  Mind you, we are long time (pubg mobile, rainbow six) players. We've had our time and fun in other games too - valo, fortnite, csgo, warzone, you name it. So this time, we again decided to try it for fun, more off i asked the bois to try it one more time because of how much i missed the game and the past glory days we've had in mobile. It's the nosta and the fact that no one wants to play mobile that made us do this. So i gave it a try. Played around 30 to 40 matches as of now. And guess what? The game is just horrible man. No wonder they made it free. Like i said, some of my friends even paid to play that nostalgic game we all grew up with(mobile) but in pc . But no one knew how bad it was gonna be.  The movement is soo bad. You realize it more when you come from some other game. When you have only played PUBG PC or you strictly follow this game only, you wont realize it. My man(character) takes his own sweet time to move a muscle. You cant dodge like you can in other game. It is sooooo frustrating. Recoil, some might say that recoil in this game is realistic and ill give them that. That is my least concern because recoil is something you can master if you are given the time and interest to practise. But how can you in this game when you're nothing but a loot bag for top players the company is pampering for. I feel like in pc, we are the bots. In mobile there were actual bots and in Pc we dont see actual bots because we low lvls are the BOTS. Its just horrible. Very disappointed. The movement is the main issue because like i said, when you are used to other games, and u start playing this garbage, its just soo irritating. Its like the character will only do one thing at a time. You cant have a proper gun fight. Where as in mobile its just soo smooth and easy. I've seen players who were utter garbage in mobile but could take their time and learn because they had the chance to do so. All the issues i have with PC is alright if only WE WERENT BOT LOOT BAGS for high levels. The game is just filled with high levels and low levels got no chance. Never returning to this game again. Had enough! It makes me sad to sit and type all of this for a game i dearly loved back in the day and have had wasted soo much of my time on. I am not even sad about the time part because we've had soo much fun and have made soo many memories in this game(Mobile)."

578080,159548435,1709224223,1,952,0.5,"Gameplay: PUBG's gameplay is pretty straightforward: jump out of a plane, grab gear, and try to be the last one standing. It's a simple concept, but it's also where the game can get a bit rough around the edges.  One of the biggest gripes players have is with the shooting mechanics. Sometimes it feels like you're firing a Nerf gun instead of a deadly weapon. Plus, the randomness of loot spawns and circle placements can leave you feeling like luck plays a bigger role than skill.  Graphics: Graphically, PUBG is decent. The maps are diverse and well-designed, offering plenty of variety. However, the game's visuals aren't exactly cutting-edge. Compared to newer games in the genre, PUBG can look a bit dated.  Performance: Performance-wise, PUBG has come a long way since its early days, but it still has its issues. Frame rate drops and stuttering can be common, even on powerful PCs. It's not a deal-breaker, but it can be annoying when you're in the heat of battle.  Community: PUBG's community is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, you've got a dedicated fan base that loves the game. On the other hand, the community can be pretty toxic, especially to new players. The learning curve is steep, and getting started can be tough.  Value: In terms of value, PUBG is pretty standard. The base game is affordable, but the costs can add up if you start buying cosmetic items and battle passes. Some players have criticized the game for being too aggressive with its monetization, but it's all optional.  Conclusion: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a game that has had a huge impact on the gaming world. It brought battle royale into the mainstream and inspired countless other games. But it's also a game that has its flaws. If you can look past some of its rough edges, PUBG can still offer plenty of thrills."

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

578080,158991961,1708625629,1,2496,0.5,"Playing PUBG: Battlegrounds has been quite an experience. The game’s realistic simulation and massive zones make it stand out among other battle royales. The thrill of survival after parachuting into the open world is unmatched. The need to be stealthy and tactical adds a layer of complexity that I appreciate. Waiting for a passing aircraft to drown out my footsteps or using a smokescreen to distract enemies are just some of the strategies I’ve used.  However, the game isn’t without its flaws. The wide selection of guns can be clunky to fire, especially compared to other modern shooters. The weapons are more tolerable in third-person mode, but they’re frustratingly inaccurate unless you switch to first-person or aim down sights. This can be a bit of a letdown, especially when you’re in the heat of a firefight.  Despite these issues, I still find myself coming back to PUBG: Battlegrounds. The game’s emphasis on realistic bullet physics sets it apart in an interesting way. It’s not as slick as some other games, but the intensity of the fights keeps me engaged. The game has managed to stay relevant and enjoyable with continuous updates and a player-focused approach. It’s a compelling choice for anyone seeking a challenging and realistic battle royale experience. All in all, I’d say PUBG: Battlegrounds is worth a shot."

Now after 8 years, after having played 1400 hours of PUBG since it's early release I decided to do a review about it, and probably that will be my last review, at least for years... The game is unplayable right now due to cheaters. After 1400 hours, I can distinguish who is a cheater and who is a good player. Game devs absolutely do not care about that, they are in fact happy. After the game became free, they only care about their sh*tty skin sales and other monetizing stuff. Any player who thinks coming across cheaters frequently is utterly infuriating should not play this game, the game is literally dead due to unhampered cheaters. Go and play other games that actively eliminate cheaters if you can't stand this situation not even a second, and enjoy them knowing that you are not wasting your precious time"

578080,158222854,1707824070,0,21597,0.5625,"As a player who eagerly jumped into PUBG from the very beginning (2017), I was captivated by its promise of intense battles and exhilarating moments. The thrill of being dropped onto an island, scrounging for weapons, and battling it out against dozens of other players had me hooked from the start.  One of the most frustrating aspects of PUBG is its lack of meaningful updates and improvements. Despite numerous promises from the developers, the game has remained stagnant, with fundamental issues such as optimization problems and server issues persisting for years.  Furthermore, the introduction of paid loot boxes and microtransactions has soured the experience, turning what was once a fair and balanced playing field into a pay-to-win nightmare. It's disheartening to see a game that once prided itself on skill and strategy devolve into a cash grab fueled by greed.  To add insult to injury, the constant influx of cosmetic items, particularly those catering to the Asian market, has only served to clutter the game and detract from its immersive atmosphere. Instead of focusing on meaningful gameplay improvements, the developers seem more interested in churning out superficial additions to milk players for more money.  As a longtime fan of PUBG, it pains me to see how far the game has fallen. What started as a promising concept has been squandered by poor management decisions and a lack of commitment to delivering a quality experience. Unless significant changes are made, I can no longer in good conscience recommend PUBG to anyone looking for a satisfying gaming experience."

578080,158003067,1707576242,1,71553,0.5,"The game has some issues with cheaters but there is a decent enough reporting system in place that handles them and hands out bans fairly frequently. The game has seen constant updates which is always necessary for games like this and I think why it retains the player base that it currently has.  Combat can be fun but frustrating sometimes when in the heat of the moment you suffer damage that may have been different than what you were expecting. There is a variety of maps that I wish were in constant rotation because I feel that a given rotation has a map removed for an entire month and I like to experience all the different places to play at.  There is a huge amount of different currencies and tokens that can be frustrating to navigate and add complexity to cosmetic crafting that is unnecessary. It can be disheartening to find out you need several hundred dollars worth of currency to upgrade a progressive weapon or have to stick to playing the game for dozens if not hundreds of hours to complete it otherwise. I've never approved systems like this but to each their own. Overall, I think it's a fun experience, enhanced when you play with people you like instead of random strangers but even that can bring benefits. Partying up is easy enough and lobbies usually never have issues in staying intact. Drop in and get kitted because PUBG is ready for you."

I feel like the game got only worse since then - the game got bloated with lootboxes, skins, cases, battlepasses, gacha mechanics etc. There were no improvements to combat cheaters. There were no optimization improvements since the beginning, it feels like the lags got only worse - over time it became PUBGs style to register your shots, grenades, punches etc. after half a second. The FPS on my high end machine got only worse. The developers only goal here is to extract as much money out of you pockets - there will be no other improvements.

The first problem that my friends and I have are always new and new irrelevant map updates or even more uninteresting new maps made according to the same principle. The only good map in the last 2 years is Deston both in terms of looks and the secret rooms (better weapons and equipment) in it and the use of the drone (but guess what? there were new updates and the drones disappeared and thus made the rooms useless, and on top of that there is still a chance to get deston in a random map for a real 5%, especially with the arrival of Taego 2 (Rondo). All maps are made according to the principles of Korea, China and completely uninteresting (sorry, not all of them, but the ones we have to play, because you get Erangel or Miramar or Deston as rarely as you'll find a flare gun in the game). Not to mention that the maps are unblockable and you have to go out and in and out and in eight times... just to play one normal map that was in this game from beginning. There were also some minimaps, but luckily someone had the sense to remove it and put it to a minimum (they appear every 4-8 months, like some kind of hemorrhoid)  The second problem the most shittiest anticheat there is in 2024 the price would go to PUBG !!! Swarm of cheaters in every game (they get banned but they can make an account in 1 minute and continue to play - it should be that they can only play the game via digital platforms like steam, because here I doubt that anyone will buy a new phone, make new mail and buy new games when they are banned, the fact is that there would be a lot less of them than there are now), if you are unable to make a prober anticheat that is.  Third problem is the ugly cosmetics for the players' weapons and clothes (80% for garbage), considering that it takes you 10 minutes (if you look at some i would say you are competing who can make it faster and uglier) to make some skin for weapons or clothing, you could at least make one that coincides with some other culture than Asian (dragon on dragon on dragon with some ugly bunnies and 10000 diffrent colors...its getting really annoying oooo dont forget asian-fusion (make viking horns put something asian on it - this will sell for sure)   I have nothing against any culture and respect everything, but if you sell something as a global game (try to include something global as well). Or the game will decline, as it has in the last few years.  The only good things in recent years was the collaboration with McLaren and Aston Martin and the new map Deston (without later updates)."

From time to time you may be in a lobby that is really only 3 teams and everyone else is bots, you will get the occasional cheater and compared to other BR games out there the pace of a PUBG match is quite a bit slower. Additionally the removal of Solo FPP is extremely frustrating, especially when they still keep the Team Deathmatch servers up that can never be filled as not enough players play it.   In saying all of this, I came back to this game after 3 years playing other games and the changes they have made to balancing, Quality of life improvements, new features and even the silly missions has made me genuinely enjoy this game as they seem to really be taking feedback from a larger stand point and look to improve the game with each update.   When looking at other notable titles such as Fortnite, APEX Legends or the kiddy friendly Farlight, the play-style of PUBG still stands tall. Unlike these other titles, this game has a deeper tactical feel more akin to CS or Siege and if you can get 2 or 3 of your mates to all come together, hours of fun ensues. If you are a 100% solo player, may have more fun on the aforementioned titles above, however if you are looking to play with others, have genuine fun and have a more tactical shooter experience while still knowing this is just casual fun - I would recommend this game over CS2 in a heartbeat."

But after taking a break from pubg for a couple years, I find that the game is completely unplayable due to crippling connection issues to servers.  I've been looking into this issue for a couple days now and I haven't found any fix that seems to help.  I know it's not my internet and I don' t have any issues playing other games so this seems to be a pubg issue.  I've also heard about the cheating issue (I haven't experienced it though seeing how i can't even play the game.)  Overall it makes me sad that the devs can't prioritize fixing major issues with the game, but would rather add more and more unnecessary content to try to make money.  This game has always had its flaws but was still overall a good game that was a lot of fun to play.  Now it's one of the worst battle royale games out there and that make me sad."

It is sad there’s not any better alternative if you’ve played this. Please never buy this game if you don’t have anything better to do, it is a waste of money and will make you rage. I think the game is at its all time low - January 2024.  Positive: - Making kills actually gives an adrenaline rush. - Winning a game actually feels meaningful. - Weapon handling is nicely balanced and you can actually get your own style, you’re not forced to play with a certain gun or loadout.  Negative: - Hard to learn, you’re against people with 1000+ hours that will kill you before you see them. - Takes a ton of time to learn the maps. - Maps are rotating and can’t be chosen. - Be prepared to be killed by sweatlords. - Be prepared to kill some dumb AI when you expect players. - Be prepared to get destroyed by cheaters, which you report and get banned for 1 day. and yes they are mostly Chinese and Russian. - They want you to spend $$ on skins and seasonpasses. Please don’t buy crates to get weapon skins, it is a scam. - The Eula Roofing is next level, they own all your private information if you accept. its just chinese spyware - The game is actually unstable with certain hardware, you have to be lucky. - Added AI to normal games, so you can loot money to buy a better loadout, completely ruining the game - Killing other players. - Bugs never really get fixed, just one of the many examples: try scoping while leaning close to a wall and you will scope into the sky. - Figuring out the recoil of a weapon and getting the muscle memory is hard when everyone is better than you. - Takes an eternity to load the lobby after every single match. Matchmaking takes ages and can be bugged so you have to leave after a few minutes to try it again."

Set against the backdrop of a sprawling island landscape, players are thrust into a high-stakes battle for survival, where only the strongest, smartest, and most skilled will emerge victorious.  [*]At its core, PUBG excels in its ability to deliver an adrenaline-fueled experience that keeps players on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The game's signature blend of intense gunplay, strategic decision-making, and heart-pounding tension creates a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience that is unmatched in its intensity. From the rush of adrenaline as the final circle closes in to the euphoria of securing a hard-fought victory, every match is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and excitement.  [*]Central to the PUBG experience is its emphasis on player choice and emergent gameplay. With a vast array of weapons, vehicles, and equipment at their disposal, players are given the freedom to approach each match in their own unique way, whether it be through stealthy infiltration, aggressive combat, or tactical teamwork. The open-ended nature of the game's sandbox environment encourages creativity and experimentation, inviting players to adapt and innovate in the face of ever-changing challenges.  [*]Moreover, PUBG boasts stunning visuals and immersive sound design that further enhances the player's experience. From the lush landscapes of Erangel to the rugged terrain of Miramar, every aspect of the game's audiovisual presentation is meticulously crafted to draw players deeper into the world of battle royale. The attention to detail is palpable, with the crackle of gunfire and the roar of engines serving to heighten the sense of immersion and intensity.  [*]However, PUBG is not without its flaws and frustrations. The game's steep learning curve and punishing difficulty may prove daunting for newcomers, requiring patience and perseverance to master its mechanics and tactics. The unforgiving nature of its gameplay can lead to moments of frustration and disappointment, as players are often left at the mercy of luck and circumstance in the heat of battle.  [*]Furthermore, PUBG performance and optimization issues may detract from the overall experience, with frequent frame rate drops, server lag, and connection issues disrupting the flow of gameplay. While efforts have been made to address these concerns through updates and patches, they remain persistent challenges that can impact the enjoyment of the game for some players.  [*]In conclusion, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS stands as a testament to the power of the battle royale genre, offering players a thrilling and immersive experience that pushes the boundaries of multiplayer gaming. With its intense action, strategic depth, and emergent gameplay, PUBG invites players to test their mettle in the ultimate test of skill and survival. While its flaws and frustrations may test the resolve of some players, its adrenaline-fueled excitement and heart-pounding intensity make it a journey well worth undertaking. As players parachute into the battlegrounds, they are reminded that in the chaos of battle, victory belongs to those bold enough to seize it. [/list]"

Ranked is just completely not functional. You can't queue for a ranked game at all. I spent hours grinding to level 80 just so I could try to play ranked and it was a complete letdown. The barrier to Ranked entry is just way too high. Even in casual/normal, half the players are bots. Killing someone or surviving no longer feels rewarding anymore.  The only reason I recommend this game is because the movement and aesthetic of this game is a lot better than Warzone, Apex, or Fortnite in my opinion.

578080,156581260,1705960292,0,160,0.50472337007522583,"Kind of boring and empty Battle Royale game, in my opinion.  PUBG was the first Battle Royale game I played, when the genre was still new for me. I liked its style of playing, with the arena that got smaller over time, finding weapons to defend yourself against other players and the teamwork when playing with friends.   My fun however, was short-lived with this game. This was mainly because I thought it looks and feels a little empty. I played many times with friends, and even then, I got this feeling. Normally when I play any game with friends, this is not the case, so for me, I knew that this was not a game that I would play for many years.  The graphics in PUBG are a little boring. I did not expect shiny next generation visuals or something, but everything is almost the same color, green grasslands with a orange sky. It looks kind of realistic, like everyday life, but the whole atmosphere just felt hollow. The sound effects from weapons are great and get close to realism.  The controls and movement are a little stiff and felt a little slow. This is mainly because of the big world you are walking in, making a mile really feel like a mile.   My problem, as always, with this kind of games, is that I am just not skilled enough. I try very hard to stay alive and kill another player, but they are always faster than me. Well, in a game like Counter Strike for example, this is fine, I respawn immediately and can try again and might get some kills and streaks afterwards. But with games like PUBG, you walk around, collect stuff, do not see a living soul in sight and then *Bam*, dead. For me, the game is over and I need to find another server to play on.   Then you got the fact that this game felt like Battlefield 2, my arch nemesis when talking online shooters. Massive open, empty world, walk for miles and miles, and then get shot. It was some sort of Vietnam flashback for me and I immediately disliked the game by the second.  The biggest problem, that has been patched if I am not mistaken, was that players could turn down their graphics to potato mode, in which grass and foliage disappeared. This gave them a huge advantage over players that were hiding in the grass to avoid being killed. For me, this almost killed all the fun I had with the game at the time.   In the end, PUBG was fun for a couple of hours, and I had some joy with it, but with the knowledge of today, I prefer Apex Legends over this one anytime.  For me personally, I would not recommend this game."
578080,156573605,1705952443,1,322631,0.5,"Still the best realistic FPS battle royale game. The game is still fairly well supported with new maps, guns, vehicles etc. being consistently added to the game. If another realistic BR game was released to compete with PUBG, I'd consider it, but I think the next step will be PUBG converting to Unreal Engine 5 and updating the graphics.  Many other battle royale games are goofy and less tactical in that you end up spamming movement, building etc just to be evasive. PUBG has leaning, recoil, bullet velocity and drop, attachments etc.  All of which feel really good for gun play mechanics. This is essentially the cs player's BR game.  This game is meant to be played in First Person Perspective (FPP) and in a Squad. The problem with Third Person Perspective (TPP) is that you don't have to expose your character to peak around a corner and dying to somebody that is abusing this mechanic feels really bad. Everybody is entitled to play what they enjoy, but the vast majority of players prefer FPP. If you're new, playing solo is going to feel bad as you have nobody to teach you or help you when you're facing sweaty veteran players. Try to find players to squad up with by queuing into squads and playing with your team. Then join the players that you enjoyed squading with if they're willing to add you. Practice your recoil control in practice mode and team death match to get better. If you only ever play normal BR mode, you only get a few opportunities to fight a player who is better than you before being sent back to the lobby. Team Death Match fixes that and gives you attempt after attempt to learn to play against more experienced players. Pay close attention to sound cues from footsteps or gunfire as this is critical to being able to react quickly. It's a bit of an uphill climb for new players but if you've played other shooters you should be alright if you stick with it.  I've found that as the game has matured, the community has gotten a lot more close knit and friendly which is actually nice. I seldom am stuck playing alone at this point. There are plenty of times where I can recognize players in the kill feed and know what I'm up against.  People complain constantly about cheaters, but in most cases, if you're really being honest with yourself and watch your deathcam, the player that killed you was just better. Every now and then I die to players that are suspect but it's actually fairly rare. Most of the time, you're dying to somebody with thousands of hours on the game (since this game is nearly 7 years old) who CAN actually turn on a dime and double headshot you from 100 meters away. I know this may seem ridiculous but if you watch pro players, you'll see that it is actually possible. Sometimes I surprise myself with the shots that I hit as one of those players. Actual cheaters are banned on a weekly basis, and it does seem like the developers are doing what they can to combat cheating. The fact that the game is free to play is always going to present a problem though where anybody that is determined enough to cheat will simply create a new account to cheat on when their current account gets banned.  All in all, there isn't a game out there that provides the same level of strategy and tension that you get from PUBG, and I look forward to Unreal Engine 5 giving the game a much needed graphics overhaul."

578080,156297363,1705673650,1,2632,0.5,I'm forced to write this review.
578080,156290187,1705665432,0,93923,0.5,"I've played PUBG for quite a few years now.  I think I first discovered it in 2016 or so.  I always loved its more realistic gunplay, combined with tactics that, while still obviously game-y, faithfully replicated some real-world infantry combat strategies.  As a former infantryman myself, I liked that I could apply at least some of the basic concepts I learned in the field and reap genuine benefits in most combat encounters in this game.  But ever since it became free to play, it has become a mixed nightmare of decent, fun experiences, and just infuriating, cheater-fueled bulls***t.  I'm writing this review after a particular game where, playing BR solos, I was driving in a vehicle at 120 km/h - that's ~75 mph for my fellow Americans - and a guy with an AUG and a red dot, over 200m away from me, full auto headshotted me in less than half a second while I was traveling perpendicular to his direction of aim.  But if that wasn't enough, after he killed me he instantly spun around 120 degrees to start shooting at someone else, never leaving his iron sights the entire time.  That's not a player scanning his field of fire and acquiring a target, that's not a sniper adjusting fire for an enemy repositioning - that's somebody who's using hacks to locate and aim at players and kill them for him. [EDIT: literally as I was writing this review, that guy actually got banned inside of an hour of my reporting it, which is really rare, as most reports take several days or a week to produce a ban...but it was only a 24 hour temporary ban.  So he'll just be at it again tomorrow, or switch to another free account and keep doing it right now]  I was always told that to be good at PUBG, you needed at least 1000 hours of playtime, that that was where you could start to expect to see some improvements in your performance, because it was a really skill based game and you had to practice a lot to be able to compete.  I have almost 1500 hours in this game, and I have been 180 headshot killed by players who, according to their account stats, were playing their literal first ever game.  I've been instantly M24 headshotted while I was in a vehicle by people who, again according to their account stats, have played the game for a grand total of about 10 hours in the last year.  Nowadays, most players who kill me have played for less than 20 hours across the last 6 months.  I recently had a guy who ran to a top of a hill, and IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A SECOND did all of the following: spun 90 degrees, raised his 4x scoped Kar98k, located me, compensated for the distance and bullet drop, fired and hit the top fifth of my helmet that was protruding over the top of a tractor - over 300m away from him.  I reported him for cheating and nothing happened.  And I can already hear the chorus of people telling me I need to ""git gud"" or that I'm just complaining about people being better at the game than me.  So, OK, let's say that's true.  Let's disregard everything I've said, and all of my admittedly anecdotal evidence.  I have enough records in my match history to make it a sample rather than just anecdotes, but for the sake of argument, let's dismiss everything I've said.  All the examples I've offered are wrong or outliers, and so we should just look at the data instead.  Krafton perma-bans somewhere around 80-100k players EVERY WEEK.  Sometimes it's less, and sometimes it's a lot more.  That's the rough average.   This has been the case for the past 3 or 4 years, at least as long as I've been tracking it.  Literally every week, that many accounts get banned, mostly for cheating (a minority of others for teaming, abuse, harassment, etc).  The thing is...PUBG has a peak of around 800k players at a time.  More often it's floating around 400-500k.  And they ban 80-100k *every week*.  At that rate, their entire playerbase would be banned within a month.  But they've been banning at that rate, 80-100k every single week, for YEARS.  Hundreds of weeks of those kinds of bans, so MILLIONS of accounts banned.  What that tells us, because it's a free to play game, is that all the people who get banned just make new accounts and immediately keep playing - and cheating.  The bans are meaningless.  Cheating isn't actually punished in a way designed to stop it.  As a corollary to that concept, teamkilling is also pretty rampant.  Over my last 4 weeks of playing in random squads, I've had an average of at least 1.5 players per week who deliberately kill their own squad.  It's almost always been people who are account level <10 (out of a max account level of 2500).  Had a teammate recently who came up behind me while I was pulling security out a window. He shot me in the head, then punched me to death after I was downed.  Looted all my stuff, and when another teammate came to investigate/respawn me, he killed him too and took his stuff.  Guy was account level 4.  I reported it and he got ""temporarily banned"" for about 3 days.  Obviously a player like that doesn't care, they're probably doing it to troll for the lols on their streaming channel.  Even if they get permabanned, they'll just create a new account and keep doing it.  The free-to-play system 100% enables that kind of behavior, if not outright encourages it.  The overall point is that while a lot of the fundamental gameplay mechanics are still fun, the way the game is being run at the corporate level encourages, or at least wholly fails to discourage, cheating, trolling, and abuse.  The only meaningful way to stop or limit that is to reverse the game's free-to-play status; if it were even just $10 to purchase and play, it would drastically reduce the cheating and griefing, because it would cost $10 every time you f'd around and got banned.  But since it's free, permabans just mean ""hey, we want you to keep playing, just go make a new account with a different free email address first.""  Krafton seems more focused on milking the cosmetic microtranscations  and keeping the playerbase inflated, rather than making it an actual enjoyable experience for the average gamer.  Which makes me sad, because this game always had a lot of potential in the right hands.  It's a shame it's in the wrong hands now.  EDIT: My recent experiences of being killed by one player who - in the last 6 months - achieved Master V rank (Master is  basically equivalent to the top 1% of ranked players worldwide), and who has a 0.5 K/D in unranked matches, and another who has played the game for about 50 hours total and has a 60:1 K/D with longest kills routinely over 900m, significantly diminished my faith in any data this game (or its publishers) puts out."

A game that once stood as a pinnacle of the battle royale genre, now finds itself shackled by an insurmountable problem: an epidemic of cheaters that has left the gaming experience in shambles. As an avid supporter of the game, it's disheartening to witness the degradation of fair play at the hands of those who exploit and manipulate PUBG's mechanics with blatant disregard for the principles of integrity. The issue of cheating has reached such alarming proportions that it feels as if PUBG Corporation has relinquished control of its own creation, allowing an unchecked proliferation of aimbots and wall hacks to run rampant.  Despite promises of improved anti-cheat measures, the reality on the ground paints a different picture. PUBG's feeble attempts to curb cheating have proven ineffective, leaving players to navigate a virtual battlefield marred by the constant threat of encountering dishonest players. The once-thrilling engagements that defined PUBG's appeal are now overshadowed by the fear that each firefight may be tainted by the presence of a cheater, eroding the trust and enjoyment of the player community."

The game also gives out a lot of free rewards through log-in events and other seasonal events that appear almost every week/month that provide a rewarding feeling for playing and logging in which keeps the player base alive, a feature a lot of other games could do with.  It also usually has a good battle pass with A LOT of rewards in in it where you don't feel bad for buying it, given that it also gives G-COIN at the end of it usually I think also helps.  Honestly a solid game, with solid rewarding game play and a rather generous distribution of items, which is only a good thing as it makes you want to play the game even more."

Tried everything I could find online to try to fix but nothing works.   TLDR Don't buy, this game is unplayable"

The game has strayed so far from the original gritty and sort of realistic shooter that it once was. Nothing makes really sense in the new additions. Like they have introduced basically magic to the game.  Seem like they wants to turn it into fortnite The guns are badly balanced too, the meta revolve really only around max 40% of them. With many who isnt used at all, and hasnt been for too long, why not remove them or make the part of the meta atleast?  The one good thing that they have done is adding a revive system but they cant decide which system that they want, some maps use blue chip, other uses a comeback-arena, and some doesnt even have one."

Laughing hysterically at crazy vehicle mechanics. Bitching about rats, sweats, red zones and unlucky circles. As the honeymoon phase wore off you started to notice their little issues. They started to annoy you more and more. Eventually it got so bad you gave up on them for good. Had a huge fight and went your separate ways. Good riddance. You thought your life was better. You dated Apex for a while but that spark wasn’t there. You fooled around with Warzone and something was just missing. Hell you even got into a long term relationship with Tarkov. But the entire time you were comparing them to PUBG. You heard they went free to play. Wow desperate much? Was that just a ploy to get your attention? Were they thinking about you this whole time too? Well the rats in EFT have gotten so bad it’s unplayable… Should we.. give this another try? Wow okay the performance is actually improved, looks like they learned a thing or two while they were discovering theirselves. Damn theres still seemingly random crashes every %$@&ing day, but you know what, you’re home. This is where you were meant to be.

Yeah sure, the game went downhill for a bit, but have you played it recently? Just because big time streamers don't play it anymore doesn't mean it sucks. Nowa'days, even with bots, this game feels really good. Don't sleep on the bots, they are fucking ruthless if you're not paying attention. I find myself getting into game without any bots, trust me..you can tell. Also, there are still monthly reports of players getting banned. Maintenance has always been a pain in the DICK, but all for it to run this smooth after so many years, sure, I'm definitely game. WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER."

578080,154982243,1704122555,0,5250,0.5,"Back when PUBG first dropped in 2017, it was the hot thing. Fast forward, and the player base has taken a nosedive. The game's dealing with a bunch of issues – cheaters everywhere, weapons that feel off, and gameplay that's just not cutting it anymore. Even big-shot streamers like Shroud and DrDisrespect bailed on PUBG streaming because it's just not pulling in the crowds like it used to.  What's really grinding gears is how the devs seem to care more about pumping out skins for a game that feels like it's on life support. Core issues with the gameplay? They're not getting the attention they deserve. The lack of a solid anti-cheat system is like an open invitation for cheaters to ruin the fun for those of us who used to dig PUBG.  It's a bummer seeing the focus on making money from skins instead of fixing what's broken. If you're thinking of dropping some cash on a game, you might want to look elsewhere. PUBG's in a bit of a sorry state right now, and there are plenty of other games out there offering a better time."
578080,154971274,1704112338,0,56345,0.486725687980651855,"The game itself is fun, as you can see from my hours played. The anti-cheat system, however, is taken way too seriously. I have been temporarily banned 4 times in a month even though I'm 100% sure I haven't violated any terms of service. This is not an isolated case, I have found countless other cases of people in the exact same spot. Even people that have been wrongfully permabanned only to get unbanned after months when PUBG inevitably realizes their mistakes.  The support you get always comes down to 'we can't help you due to security reasons'.   Also, they install software on your computer that monitors it 24/7, even when you're not playing pubg. If they detect you using a random software such as Unity, they'll flag you, even if you're not using that software whilst playing the game."

578080,154768489,1703904875,0,245477,0.5,"Playtime: 3088 hours Purchased: Dec 28, 2018 ★☆☆☆☆ - Deeply Disappointing After Years of Commitment As a long-time player of PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, with over 3000 hours invested since late 2018, it's with a heavy heart and deep frustration that I write this review. My journey with this game has been a rollercoaster. The early days were filled with excitement, challenges, and a community that brought endless hours of enjoyment. However, recent experiences have completely overshadowed these fond memories. The primary issue began with the game's anti-cheat system. Despite my commitment and fair play, the system repeatedly failed to load on my PC. This technical glitch led to a message stating, ""Your game will be shut down in 10 seconds. Verify your PUBG game integrity from Steam."" Following all the suggested steps, including verifying game files and restarting my PC, I hoped for a resolution. But then, the final straw: a sudden and shocking 72-hour ban. There are no explanations, no support, just a blunt and unjustified punishment for an issue that seems entirely on their end. This isn't an isolated incident but a recurring problem that has destroyed the fun and fairness of the game. Contacting the support team yielded no real help, only adding to the frustration. It feels like a slap in the face to a loyal player. Spending thousands of hours in a game world should build a relationship of trust and respect, but this has been completely eroded. It's heartbreaking to say, but PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is no longer the game I fell in love with. What used to be an escape into a thrilling world has turned into a source of annoyance and disappointment. To anyone considering this game, please be wary. The game has its highs, but when the lows hit, they hit hard, especially when your commitment is met with unjust bans and unhelpful support."

Imagine if in Dead by Daylight you had people who had played 10,000 to 15,000 matches in every single game, you have no way to catch up with in skill.  There are 3 game modes, Ranked, Normal and Casual.  These life time players are all in Casual as well.  Imagine if in real life soldiers were standing and crouching every second and when shooting contort their body left and right like Matrix bullet time but they are aiming and shooting at the same time. Now sprinkle in a huge quantity of cheaters you will see on the regular who use a variety of wall hacks, aim bots or no recoil cheats and you have very few actually fun games.  Ranked is dead according to some, I haven't tried, I've watched someone attempt it on Asian servers and it was literally cheaters against cheaters.  Best at cheating wins."

The first issue you'll run into is the optimization. It has mostly stayed the same since the launch of the game. It isn't delightful, although the game looks like stitched-up Unity assets. Thank god this game is free now and not like it used to be. My second point is the gameplay. The recoil feels terrible, and the FP camera looks quite clunky compared to the TP point of view. The movement is bizarre. Sometimes, it feels like you're sliding on the floor, and sometimes, your character can barely move. While the game's unforgiving aspect can be adrenaline-pumping in moments when nothing is happening, the game can feel like a walking simulator. Yes, that aspect also extends to other BR games, but in PUBG, it shows because of the size of the maps.  Along with its unforgiving nature, it creates really unfun situations in which you're often killed before you even have time to react. Along with it comes lots of controversies the game and dev team had through its lifespan, like, for example, releasing an unfinished and broken port **** for consoles when the game itself still needs to be fully finished.   Apart from that, cheating is still an unfortunately unsolved problem. And it's a big enough problem to ruin your enjoyment of the game.  Overall, PUBG, on a bigger scale, may seem okay, but compared to its competition, it has nothing to offer apart from unforgiving gameplay and semi-realistic weapon systems. If you really want to play a battle royale, you've got a ton of better, free, and more fleshed-out options."

The FP mode feels good and fun. The addition with some bots in the lobbies do make it feel a bit more ""alive"", but I understand the negative part of the game feeling ""dead"" as well. I enjoy the new maps and some of the new guns. The animations/emotes are great, no matter how silly or ""not immersive"" it makes the game. I like the direction so far, it doesn't feel like a ""china number 1"" game anymore."

I know there are people complaining about cheaters and stuff, but honestly that is the case in all games. I think PUBG does its best to try and ban cheating. They issue weekly reports on the # of bans etc.   It's just sad people need to try to cheat to play. But the game itself is still Best in Class.   Love PUBG!"

From the moment you parachute onto the diverse and expansive maps, PUBG immerses you in a world where survival is not just a goal but a relentless pursuit. The realistic graphics and attention to detail create an atmosphere that is both visually stunning and tactically challenging. Every footstep, gunshot, and rustle in the distance adds to the suspense, making each match a heart-pounding adventure.  One of PUBG's standout features is its commitment to realism. The gun mechanics are meticulously designed, requiring players to master recoil control and bullet drop for effective long-range engagements. This attention to detail extends to the environmental factors, including weather changes and dynamic terrain, ensuring that no two matches feel the same.  The game's expansive player base ensures quick matchmaking, and whether you prefer the solo experience, teaming up with a duo, or coordinating with a squad, PUBG offers versatile gameplay options. Teamwork and communication are paramount, creating a social aspect that enhances the overall gaming experience.  PUBG's commitment to staying relevant is evident through regular updates and additions. The developers introduce new maps, weapons, and gameplay enhancements, keeping the community engaged and excited for what's next. The evolving esports scene adds another layer of competitiveness, offering players the chance to showcase their skills on a global stage.  The variety of maps, each with its own unique challenges, adds a strategic element to the game. Whether navigating the dense forests of Erangel or battling it out in the urban sprawl of Sanhok, every location demands adaptability and tactical thinking.  In conclusion, PUBG on Steam is a must-play for anyone seeking a challenging and immersive battle royale experience. Its realistic gameplay, dynamic environments, and vibrant community make it a standout title in the genre. Prepare for the adrenaline rush, the heart-stopping moments, and the sweet taste of victory in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds."

Even though I've played it before, the game forces me through a tutorial mission as I guess that was a newly added feature at some point. It's unskippable and guides you through shit like WASD (wow so useful).  After completing the useless tutorial mission, I'm allowed to join a match and it ends up being a sedate affair of looting empty buildings and shooting the occasional player so oblivious that I think they were bots. I jacked a car and drove around the map in search of something interesting to do, but quickly ran out of petrol.  At this point there are ~15 players left and I decide to end my participation in this snooze fest by barrelling towards the nearest firefight in a desperate bid to have some fun.  At least the game isn't nearly as buggy or laggy as it used to be, but I do remember it once upon a time actually being fun. Seems that part got lost during all the patches. The consolation prize of some lousy skins and in-game currency for once buying this game with real money is also pretty insulting."

So, so many in my old stream said, so many here said.....full of cheats. My opinion is yes, there can be cheats. I do not think it is as common as some may think. Yes I have been cheated on, well move on and shrug. If you cheat on a game, the feeling of success you will never feel, the pure greatness of winning without cheating, or even winning despite the cheats that can be there. The gun play is so nice. The design of maps, the pure love that has been put into this title, ensures this is my favourite game STILL after having bought it early. The hours I have streamed this, the practice and will not give attitude, the bad days, the good, the amazing experiences I have had in this glorious game I will never forget. Its better with others, solo is entirely ok. I liked the slower pace of earlier versions, but I understand the slow pace can put off the younger player (focus skills, the now now now element of life) well, I love a slow paced 'shoe leather' element that burnt slowly and then suddenly all hell breaks loose. Well, not quite that now, quicker, blue comes in quicker, smaller maps to keep the pace. Yeah, ok....for me would prefer the slow.....its like watching a good TV series over 10 episodes and enjoying it more because the pace changes, rather than a John WIck all action film. Well, that's all personal and JW not for me, but again I'm older than you possibly Played games since PONG and this is where we find gaming now, immersive, skill based and brilliant. For all those who have moaned, abandoned the game, stating cheat...what I have seen from streams and comments, my opinion is that it is that hard to play and win, that the person moaning has not played the required hours to become good enough. It can take 10000 hrs to perfect any action, but after 3.5K of hours, I'm good enough to expect a win here and there. For me the most go back to game ever. Yeah im 58,, yeah I might not be as fast as I used to be (biological but debatable) and THAT'S why this game is great, you can use tasctics and play smart and for someone with less than razor sharp reactions, its entirely possible to win with tactics. I have won without firing a single shot. Its possible. Each game is like a memory and also a new experience all rolled into one."

Add them to a mixing bowl.  Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.  Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.  Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.  While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.  Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.  Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.  Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.  Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.  Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.  Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.  Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.  At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.  Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.  Enjoy your meal!"

Imagine this: you're parachuted onto a remote island with nothing but a shopping list. Your mission? To gather groceries while avoiding being turned into a human kebab by fellow shoppers. The supermarket is your battleground, and the aisles are your trenches.  Forget peaceful shopping. Here, it's all about grabbing that last can of beans like it's a gold bar in Fort Knox. And if you're lucky enough to find the frying pan, congratulations, you're now the Iron Chef of combat cookery. It's a game of hide-and-seek, but instead of hiding behind curtains, you're crouching in a bush with a sniper rifle, eyeing the frozen food section.  You'll form alliances only to have them crumble over who gets the last pack of ramen. And just when you think you've got a moment to breathe and admire the picturesque sunset, you remember there's a deadly force field shrinking around you, pushing everyone into the ultimate food fight finale.  In the end, whether you're the last one standing or get taken out by a rogue rolling pin, you'll leave with your heart racing and a newfound appreciation for peaceful grocery shopping. PUBG: where 'checkout' has a whole new meaning."

Ugly gun play imo.  Apparently full of hackers but roams the top 5 played games daily.  Too much $$$ for devs to make off of hacks and they likely help make them anyway.  Double money.  First and last battle royale I ever played.  It's not Free to Play because it takes time to play and time is the most valuable thing.

578080,153106976,1702026323,1,51179,0.5,"Credit where credit is due. PUBG pioneered the battle royal genre. There are some things I'm not a fan of personally but overall PUBG is a great game and among the best FPS PVP in the world objectively for its gunplay, movement, environment, and physics.  TLDR  Pros PUBG has the best bullet physics of any shooter I've ever played hands down. The options you have in combat are diverse in a massive and detailed sandbox  Cons Really, there's only one problem with this game for me: Pacing. Im not a fan of having to find the equipment i want to use This mechanic boils down to most of my experience being 99% shopping simulator 1% combat. Also, the shrinking zone mechanic will often force fights youre not prepared for (by design). Its a shame that because the ring forces constant movement, the opportunity to utilize the long range combat is rare. Both of these ""cons are typically associated with the Battle Royal style so I can't say this is a PUBG problem exclusively.  However, there's an instant action mode that provides set loadouts for deathmatches if youre not up for the BR scenario  In contrast, Rainbow 6 Siege offers the the best pacing of any FPS I've played and brilliantly bypasses the bullet physics by design of close quarters scenarios.  All in all PUBG is an exceptional game and now its free. (I bought it -_-) Absolutely worth a try for anyone who enjoys pvp shooters and long range sniping in particular."
578080,153104202,1702022446,0,24794,0.476190477609634399,"The game is not optimized very well. On my computer it has also bugged out a few times, losing sound - not responding properly to keyboad input.   It can be fun to play with friends - though the number of cheaters does make it a problem, despite the publisher's work to ban them. Overall I would not recommend this game.  I have now played it even more. Steam asked me if I want to revise my review. I still think it is not a good game.  It also has no broccoli. Huge downside.  Dr. Broccoli."

Without a decent card and setup, you're going to be at a disadvantage versus some 240hz 4090ABCXXXti dude/chick/He/She/Me/Them/Thou in his mom's basement. Its just how shit rolls. If youre offended because I hit one of your 3rd genders, well, fuck you. Sorry, not sorry   2) The implementation of a deathcam is probably one of the best things (and only things) the game does right, where it lets you see from your killer's POV, and you can then see like ""Wow holy fuck that was stupid, why did i run like some braindead zombie out in the field and get hard railed by some sniper"". It pretty much allows you to improve and NOT falsely report people for aimbotting etc., that said though, there is a sizable amount of toxic players / cheaters in-game   3) The game is pretty large, maintaining servers are expensive, i can get behind that. The recent shift in making the typical ""battlepass"" locked behind actual currency is going to be meh though. 5 bucks for a pretty sizable amount of content is kinda worth, but it's going to require some time investment as well. As crouching tiger fortune cookie states ""U No Likey, U No Buy""   TLDR: Game is trash and the ""dead game"" comments are justified. Ranked is MINIMUM 15 mins* so PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE TIME TO WASTE. Hackers AT MOST get a temp ban, then they're right back at it again in about a week or so. Doesnt matter when hackers usually have a alts to quickly hop on to. Shits legit demoralizing and i honestly feel bad for the ones who actually spent a chunk of money for skins ingame lol. So glad i didnt buy anything beyond the starter kit and pass.    its ""Free""tm, but if you decide to actually ""GiT GuuD"" you're gonna have to invest the time / money/ prayers  Edit: Seems the deathcam is only applicable in casual games , not even normies. Thats defeating the purpose of your own game's features wtf? Really wish there was a ""meh"" button for games"

They might be technically more refined and arguably better designed, but PUBG was something else. I think I just prefer the feel and lethality of its gunplay. The game's rough edges AKA eurojank actually enhanced it for me – the clunkiness and all contributed to a more intense and satisfying experience.  Don't actually play it anymore tho, rating it positively for the hundreds of hours of sheer adrenaline-inducing fun it provided back then. The introduction of bots totally killed it for me sadly. Before, knowing that every single interaction you'd have with another individual was 100% a human (and thus, super unpredictable) was the best. PUBG was almost a horror game sometimes lol no other game has ever gotten my heart pumping like that.  I miss it. I'm glad I got to experience its peak."

The only thing left to buy are the damn ugly skins they let you buy for g-coins. Well played...  So, now that i was dumb enough to pay money for g-coins to be able to get some battle passes, i have actually wasted my money. Thanks for nothing.

Plus, don't expect it to run of some shitty laptop or garbage PC like you can run fortnite or csgo or other small games as i previously pointed out it is a big game, with 10 if not 100 times the size of cs maps with many more players so requires better internet and specs to run like you'd run cs go or fortnite.

Best gunplay out of almost any shooter. Movement & Aiming isn't easy. Contrary to popular believe cheaters in this game are not super common. Usually skill issue. Recommend squad > duo > solo. Solos can be very frustrating due to the nature of pubg players being scared and afraid of pushing which leads to camping and hiding. Overall the best battle royale game currently out there.   One of the few games that still gets my blood pumping. Highly recommend it.

I get a few kills until there's only 20 left. Suddenly I get killed from across the map, one tapped by a dude with a sniper. I proceed to spectate and see him killing every other player on the server within 30 seconds. The cheating in this game is so bad that it ruins every bit of fun you could have. Even if the game you are in doesn't have a cheater, the thought that it probably does, and most likely more than one is simply enough reason not to play this crap.

578080,151859544,1700929715,1,111795,0.5,"I bought it 2018 in a sale and could not play it till I got a decent PC in 2019. It was not my type of game and I decided not to play it anymore. I thought this is my biggest fail purchase so far. But at the beginning of 2023 I gave the game a new chance as some friends asked me to join in and I was baffled how much has changed. Now I had really fun playing the game and about 90% or more of my total playtime I made this year. I really like this game. No, it is not dead and yes, it has some cheaters, but all in all they are not that crowded, at least what I have experienced so far.  Pros: - a lot of customisation options for your character - a lot of customisation options for your weapons - ingame events for new skins - a good variety of weapons - devs keep up to improve the game - fun to play with friends - no pay2win as it is now free to play  Cons: - sometimes a bit unbalanced matchmaking - sometimes addictive"

Нахера заходить вообще в катку, если тебе конченому мудаку 1 дома хватает иди в майнкрафт играй и сиди в доме до потери пульса. А другие типы вообще не вдупляют, что в этой игре делать надо, основная миссия взять пивко и в чат вырыгивать песню, которую сегодня по радио услышал. Вообщем рекомендую, тут можно найти гениев и тактиков и не признанных музыкантов с врожденными талантами во всем кроме понимания игрового процесса. Лучше игры не найти, разве только Варфейс.

Out of region players cause desync and new players find the game difficult to learn. Other than that the game is great, it has depth as long as you're willing to learn. Would recommend :)"

578080,151786175,1700908355,0,4389,0.5,"I, like many other players, am very disappointed in PUBG. This game was promised as the future of online gaming, but in reality it is a complete failure. It constantly slows down and lags, which makes the gameplay not only slow but also terribly annoying. In addition, the game's graphics look outdated and are not up to modern standards.   Also, I don't like the way PUBG developers treat their players. They don't listen to feedback and don't improve the game according to user requests. Instead, they release new updates with bugs and errors that only make the gameplay worse.  Overall, PUBG is a game that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Not only is it not enjoyable, but it is a complete waste of time and money. If you want to play a good online game, you better choose something else."

Movement is a little awkward and unique still, but the gunplay in my opinion is very enjoyable. In addition to the opportunity for quick fast games, it's a good one to have in the library. FPP is a must."

I waited and waited for it to come to console, then finally got a PC of my own. I cannot recommend PUBG anymore, it is aged and is outpaced in terms of battle royale enjoyment for me. It is slow paced, you will go 15 minutes of looting and not seeing anybody then one engagement that you have no idea where you got shot from and your back in the lobby. This isn't just me crying because I'm bad too. The amount of people playing this game that are actually from NA amounts to that less than a population of a farmstead in the middle of nebraska. You will not enjoy your time with this game once you are past your bot lobbies. Recoil will take ages to learn. Audio is so loud you can tell the room and building some dude is in from the other side of the city. You might have some good games, but overall the skill gap and sweats will stop you from enjoying over 10 hours these days."

I know the game does a good job detecting cheaters but sometimes I wonder how I was killed so easy. Season passes are worth it if you will play the game practically every day, otherwise I wouldn't buy it. I have times where I will play it for a month straight but other times I wont be interested. I assume its more fun to play with people you know but unfortunately I don't have anyone I know playing this game, so getting grouped with random people is sometimes hard. Overall fun game and better than Fornite or Call of Duty in my opinion."

I stumble upon my long-lost school buddies, bringing a touch of nostalgia to the chicken dinner chaos. 🍗🎓 The best part? We're not just surviving, we're thriving in the world of commerce background banter! 💼💬  But hold on, it's not all serious business. Whether I was celebrating a sweet victory or laughing off a defeat, PUBG became my go-to comedy club. I mean, who knew strategizing during spare time could be so hilarious? 😂🗺️  PUBG, you've been my crash course in improv strategy, and I can't thank you enough for the wild ride. 🚗🎢  Sure, some people might've lost control in the heat of the game, but for most of us, PUBG was the ultimate social hub.

578080,150263772,1700203601,1,169362,0.5,"I love PUBG and have from the my very first match and getting a chicken dinner on said first match. The gun play is absolutely unmatched, the driving is decent and it works at intended. There are many games out there that are more well suited for other people or younger audiences such as Fortnite and Apex but the do not satisfy like pubg does. There is a lot to love with pubg with the randomness and how each match is different than the last. No gunfight will be the same and it is actually challenging to get a win and it feels very well worth it when you do get one. I can play PUBG all day and granted there are many things that i do not like about the game or maybe the developers themselves but its obviously not enough to keep me away form my favorite game.....  ........ NOW FOR THE BAD......  Pubg used to cost money.... its now free to play and that was very detrimental to the game and the player base. with a free game comes what.... cheaters... new accounts....cheaters...and new accounts. how can you possibly keep someone from cheating in this game if you ban their account and they can simply just make another free account??? there are cheaters and you will encounter them i wouldn't say everyday but you will and it is very frustrating. every game has cheaters and banning them will always be a battle so cant be to hard on the devs for THAT but its still a problem note worthy. With pubg being a free game what else comes with that? well exploiting people for over priced skins and very low customization options unless they are behind an extensive paywall. you don't get to purchase the skins you want they make you use g-coin you have to purchase with real money to buy crates that have a 1 percent chance to get one of the three rare weapon skins in that season...okay lets say you get the weapon out of a crate.. sure, i have before okay well in order to upgrade your progressive skin you just got it cost blueprints which have a less that one percent chance to get out of a crate and you need polymers from scraping other skins. i have over 2000 hours in pubg and i tell you what i have NEVER got a blueprint out of a crate. not only do you need that you need at least 3 for the first skin upgrade and that's just to chance the scope skin to match the gun.... just ridiculous money grab and its a huge slap in the face to all the loyal pubg players out there who love the game but feel they are treated like crap by the devs and exploited for more money.  Other than stated there isn't much i dislike about pubg, i love the game the mechanics and almost everything about it but the cheaters and money grab is something that will forever hold me back from being 100 percent loyal to pubg and bluehole devs. if you want a game though to casually play with friends or alone and want to be competitive then give PUBG a shot. If i'm not playing Escape from Tarkov which i have 3000 hours in then im playing PUBG."
